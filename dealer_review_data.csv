4.8,"Buy about 12 trucks a year based on need from all over the country.  Absolute best experience on a used truck I could have asked for.  I live 500 miles from this dealership, truck was as described, at a fair price, with great follow up from the sales people post sale.  A genuinely good car buying experience.  "
4.7,"I have been very pleased every time I have had my Sonata Hybrid in for service and maintenance.  They are efficient, friendly and helpful with any questions I may have."
4.8,Received excellent customer service from Romel Howlader.  He answered all our questions and ensured that we were totally satisfied with our new 2020 Nissan Rogue!   Would recommend Romel to anyone looking to buy a new Nissan.
4.8,"We had previously purchased two pre-owned Subarus from Adventure Subaru buth this was our first new vehicle. Shannon, our salesperson,  was helpful but not pushy. She was knowledgeable and patient as we stumbled our way through the process. Speaking of which, was pleasant and unrushed all the way from the test drive through to financing. Would definitely recommend Shannon at Adventure Subaru to anyone in interest in purchasing a new Subaru. "
5,Thank you Robert Szyka & Corvette World Dallas for getting me into a 2018 Corvette Z06 Carbon 65 Edition. The 1st time I walked into Corvette World I went in only to ask questions and get info. Robert stopped what he was doing answered all my questions. There was never any pressure to make purchase. It was one car enthusiast (Robert) educating a long time admirer. He was so informative and genuine that after 30 minutes we where at his desk doing paper work. His informative approach & patience made me feel like this was the right decision and the right car for my wife and I. Thank you so much Robert! I'll definitely be back.
4.9,The best after sales service..Prompt service and follow up updates as you wait. The service team very professional and courteous. I can not hesitate to recommend this dealership any time 
4.7,Johnathan went above and beyond to help me get into my vehicle. Great customer service and made purchasing fun and easy!!! Way to go Johnathan!
4.8,The buying process was streamline and easy. It was the quickest process we ever experienced buying a vehicle and normally I don't like buying cars. Highly recommend Adam and thank you! 
5,New place is fantastic.  Alex was friendly and ensure all items were cared for.  The other staff were equally helping others in the facility.  Overall... A great experience. 
4.8,Saw an Audi on Selective’s website for a commuter. After walking though the heavy wrought iron doors I could tell first glance I wanted to be part of the Selective group. Thanks to Darrell and all the people behind the closed doors that made my Audi look beautiful 
4.9,"After speaking with Guy via text, we decided to drive to Perry from Yukon to look at a vehicle, we were greeted with nothing but honesty, smiles and a grateful attitude from every one. Julian was terrific with the knowledge of the vehicle, it was a pleasure dealing with him on a very easy transaction. everything from beginning to sitting in the finance office with Rick was a great buying experience. We are looking at another vehicle in the future and Vance will be our first dealership to visit."
5,"This was our first dealership experience and I'm so glad we chose this dealership to do business! We had originally gone down the road to the Ford dealership but the salesman there didn't listen to our needs and price range. We politely declined and decided to see what Clint Bowyer had to offer. David came out to greet us. He was very nice and listened to us, and didn't try to push a car on us we weren't interested in. Once we found a car and sat down to discuss the details, we understood why David's nickname is ""Simple"". Everything was straight-forward and honest, and he was very happy to answer any questions we had. I would definitely recommend this dealership!"
4.7,"Easiest and quickest car buying experience we have ever had by far! I loved that our salesman Mark was the only person we dealt with through the whole process. He was kind, honest, funny and genuine. And I love my new car! "
4.7,"I’m only giving it 1 star because the only thing they did right was my oil change. I needed new tires. I went to Doenges in May of 2019. I was told multiple times by their front service cashier, Olivia, that these exact tires were covered by road hazard warranty. And she AGAIN told me this when I was getting in my car to leave with the four new tires on my car. She also told me that as long as I went to Doenges it would be covered. Fastforward to today,  March 13 of 2020. My tire is needing to be aired up twice a week. I go to Doenges after I get off work. I just wanted them to patch my tire. ONLY to find out that there are MULTIPLE small holes in it and they’re not able to patch, or fix it. They REFUSED. They gave me a price for ONE new tire instead. When I asked about my warranty they couldn’t even pull up my receipt from the sale of the tires. They only were able to look at the part with the part Humber, as I’m told by Megan and Rich. Now I’m doing to have to buy ANOTHER tire for my car when the new tires are still NEW! IM FURIOUS! But don’t take into account the fact that I was TOLD that I had the warranty before I drove off their lot. And now they’re saying that they didn’t get my tires from a Toyota supplier and only Toyota vendor supplied tires are covered . I’m outraged, beyond livid. I will NEVER go back to Doenges. You have literally lost a customer. First of all, honesty is best. And if you can’t honor what you tell customers what makes us think that you’re being honest with your work? I will not be recommending this Toyota to anyone. Also, I have family who work in multiple Toyotas. So there’s that. I will be taking my car and my business elsewhere. What. A. Disgrace. You’re establishment is the worst and I hope many people see this and help them turn away from your business. Honestly, don’t trust this Toyota. Seriously."
5,Thank you Juan and Jesus for helping me get into a new Maxima. I love my new car. I'll be sure to send you all of my friends and family.
4.8,Always kind and  courteous and listens to my concerns. The price's are super fair with quality work no matter what the problem. Thank You
4.7,"I would like to thank Jerry Ernst for helping me get my dream car! I contacted him and that same day I purchased a car! Thank you so much for all your help and being very professional and polite and getting things done asap.

4.5,"Worst car buying experience ever! Wish negative stars was an option!
Not surprising that every one I dealt with is not listed. Every phone call/visit was one lie after another. "
4.6,Received great service from Daisy. Would purchase again. Would recommend adopting an easier way to check out. Less paperwork and more eletronic options. Also car delivery <U+0001F609>
4.6,"I received an email from Billy Bolding of a Truecar price and agreed to pay that price.
Then Billy comes out and says ""Someone got in our system and lowered the price we can't sell it for that price"" (I have it in writing from him). Then he says he can sell it for several thousand more do I still want it??? really??? why not what you put on paper? why not the truecar price we agreed to?"
4.8,"Great customer service, they found me a car that's affordable and reliable. I also love the look of the car. Great on gas too. Great experience!"
4.5,"Found a Mercedes GL350 online at Dallas Autos Direct. Was Pre-Approved by 2 finance companies before I went to test drive.. Sam made a copy of my Drivers License and sent me and my wife on a test drive.. Fell in love with the car, was ready to buy... I took my Pre-Approved offer in and JB (Hakem) looked at my interest rate and said oh no you can do better. He picked up the phone and made 2 phone calls, then he printed out a paper and told me to go .5 miles down the road to InTouch Credit Union and see Stella she will take care of me... Long story short I was ready to pay 550.00 a month for this vehicle, after the small detour I am now paying 350.00 a month with 1/4 of the interest rate..

So I am ready to give Dallas Autos Direct a 10 Star Review, however my wife is like no, not till be get the vehicle checked out.. So yesterday I took it to Park Place Mercedes for a B1 Service and check out.. Well of course after a 650.00 oil and filter change (it is a diesel) we pick it up today.. The service adviser tells me we have a real nice GL and we have nothing to worry about driving this cross country as we had asked him about..

Dallas Autos Direct will be my first call when I am looking for my next vehicle.. "
4.5,"Great guys,  not the quickest car deal I’ve ever had but it was simplified car buying.  Will do business there again in the future "
4.6,"Superb service and communication.  I bought my car from them.  Car exceeds my expectations.  I am very happy.  Al was super helpful and friendly, answering all my questions."
5,"I'm across the country and am so glad I took the leap and bought out of state, and even more glad to have done the deal with these guys. Extremely
 trustworthy, honest, knowledgeable and all of the good things you would want from the person selling you your vehicle. I'm utterly impressed with the condition of my AMG C63 and really the entire process. No complaints.
"
4.6,"Second car bought from these guys! Thank you so much Andre you were funny, honest and helpful. Than you again auto liquidators!!! Would recommend to anyone! It’s why I come back!"
4.8,They where very friendly and nice fast service. Zach is very great at his job would recommend to anyone anytime. Thanks for everything. Love my car.
5,"I had put off getting another vehicle because of all the hassles I had previously experienced over the years. Gave it another shot and wow, what a difference! Nick showed me exactly what I was looking for at an affordable price with no pressure!!  I was in and out in a flash, no hours of paper work!  So courteous and professional! I will not be hesitant again as long as Nick is there! Thank you Nick! LOVE MY JEEP!!"
4.7,"Thank You Mike, you were such a great help. We are very happy with our 535i. I will recommend you to all of our family and friends."
5,"One of the easiest car buying experiences ever.  I called to inquire about a car and spoke with Phil Lyon.  We live almost six hours away from the dealership and we were able to take care of almost everything over the phone.  We had the option of having the car shipped to us, but opted to drive and pick it up.  All the paper work and my car were ready when we arrived.  Phil was able to get me a great deal for my trade in and an even better deal on the car I wanted.  I would definitely recommend this dealership and Phil for your next vehicle purchase."
4.7,We bought a 2017 A3 worked with Derek on the purchase. We are out of town so most everything was taken care of over the phone. Derek was the upmost professional and came through with everything promised. Our experience was very good and would highly recommend Audi of Wichita.
4.5,20k dollar car they wanted 7k down. 12k dollar car they wanted 6k down? You specialize in bad credit? Who can't get you approved with half the cash price of the car as a down payment. But before this I was told I could pay 4800 for the 12k dollar car as down payment? I get a cosigner? Then they said my girlfriend can't co-sign for me after they told my girlfriend to co-sign and we could see if it lowers the high down payments. Overall received the run around from bo. Not to mention had two trade ins and make currently 17.50/hr with no bills when I applied made 13.50 before promotion? Girlfriend brings in 14/hr once again no bills. Then told she got approved by herself? Ain't that why she was my cosigner? Why would I want to make a huge payment for a car 100% in my girlfriend's name? While trading in two vehicles in my name? Plus making the huge payment? Ran my credit for no reason now and I visited based off the reviews. If you want to be approved give me half the cash for the car you want and I'll call your local bank and get you approved. Time wasted and very shady experience hearing multiple different things and asking multiple times for down payment. Bo is my bad review whole dealership shouldn't be punished for one shady dealer. 
4.4,I worked with Gabby. I was one of her first clients and she worked real hard to earn my business. She had the upmost professionalism at all times. She made sure all my questions got answered and made me feel good about the car i bought. I would reccomend her and her dealership to anyone looking for a car.
5,"We had an excellent experience with BBC Motorsports.  Their representatives are extremely professional and very knowledgeable. Their no haggle pricing is significantly better than any dealer we contacted and their inventory is excellent.  In addition, they worked with us to get the car exactly how we wanted it at NO price increase.  These are real car guys who understand their customers and go the extra to make the experience completely positive and worth while.  We worked with Jason and received excellent support and guidance, as well as great work from the supporting Techs.   Their facility is unique and very professional in appearance.  In every respect BBC Motorsports is a class act with the highest integrity, that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.   
Daniel and Colette"
5,This is the third car I have purchased from this organization. Two in Houston and the newest from the Dallas location. Ed and Bob both assisted in helping me choose a car and finalizing the deal. Both were extremely helpful. I highly recommend this dealership 
4.5,"Employees are friendly and knowledgeable. I always recommend Hillsboro Ford to friends.
I dealt with Chris, Sharon, Jeff and Matt. Thank you everyone at Hillsboro Ford."
4.6,"LOVE LOVE my new car!!! Greg Jones was the best!!Went over all options, friendly, professional, I knew that I could count on him. I would highly recommend him and this dealership!"
5,"Sam was my contact at European Motors. And he took care of everything. I bought 'long distance', which I was apprehensive about, but the experience was smooth, professional, VERY helpful, low pressure, and every step was explained fully and every question answered. And the car was exactly what I expected, and delivered to my front door in perfect condition and 'detailed' inside and out. Highly Recommended."
5,"We couldn't be happier with the car we purchased from Legacy Auto!  Our salesman, Christopher Allen, catered to our every need.  Every staff member we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful.  Their car selection is reasonable, and we didn't feel pressured into something we weren't comfortable woth.  I would definitely recommend them. I absolutely love my new Maxima."
5, I really messed up my credit and have a bunch of other out of the ordinary  factors but  I was able to get approved with a 9% down payment. Drove off the lot today a very happy customer in the truck I'd been looking at . If your looking for a vehicle and an excellent service experience this place really is worth your time. They even sent an uber to get me to the lot to complete the deal. 
4.3,Do not even think about. No one will return your call about anything. I finally bailed on my new car I had bought and took a loss and went back to Sewell Infiniti. I’m trying to finish that transaction but of course nobody will return my call.
4.6,This was the best buying experience that I have had!!  I worked with Rosalie Isern and Chelsea Mackey.  They were both super friendly!  No hassles and very upfront.  Excellent customer service!  I drove 3 hours because our local Lexus dealer was horrible!  I will say it was definitely worth the 3 hour drive for the service I received!
4.2,RACHID was great!!! He listene to what we wanted and got all of our questions answered.The whole crew we worked with from the time we got there to the end was great!
4.2,Salesman allowed us to test 3 different cars and was quite courteous. Only issue was not allowing us to get a copy of the deal offered.
5,"Purchase a 2020 Subaru Crosstrek from Randall Noe Subaru.  Shannon Wagoner is the best Sales Manager I have ever worked with, she made my purchase happen after another Dealership would not.  Everyone in the dealership is friendly & helpful from the moment you open the door.  Would not hesitate to recommend Randall Noe Subaru for your car purchase, what a great team."
4.9,We needed a more reliable car for our teenage daughter. Working with Kyle at 4M was a great experience. He understood what we were looking for and what we needed. The whole process was quick and easy.  The guys at 4M are great. 
4.2,Eric Rioja is on the run from the FBI for illegal cars sales. I would say the reviews are false and the real complains have been deleted. They screwed over 100s of people sailing cars with no titles. That why they can't get the permanent plates. Please contact your local police if you know where he is...the dealership has been closed and dealers license revoked by the DMV.....
4.4,"Buyers beware...bought a $130,000 2006 Hummer H1 from them and found out that the whole ABS system was removed by the previous owner. They were going to help resolve this, but now no one will return my calls or take my calls. Now $10,000 EXTRA out of my pocket. CROOKED STEALERSHIP!!!  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!  WATCH out for BRYCE!!!  No return calls for a month."
4.4,"I would not recommend this dealer to anyone. I send in a request for quote on Saturday night via internet. Receive an email from Matthew  the salesman on Monday morning, i proceed to try and contact him all  day calling 7 times with no response.  The next morning i receive an Email from the GM Keith(check in and introducing himself) in which i responded to him and tried to call him 5 times through the day with no response. SO that is 12 times reaching out to them with no response.  I call the general line and get to talk to another salesman that than tells me the car is now sold. Tell him what has happened  and express my concern for not getting any opportunity on the vehicle. A sales manager than calls me back Derek. Very rude person and bad attitude from the start, has no customer service skills. At one point he even says i am glad i sold it to someone else.

Stay away from a bad experience  and choose a quality dealer that will respond to each customer."
5,Had been looking for truck for weeks. Went my closest dealer with the printout of the truck I wanted and where it was located. The sales manager told me if I didn't want the similar truck at his dealer he couldn't help me then he walked away. I called Elder and told salesman Oliver Beltran what wanted and here it was. Oliver called me back in a few hours and told me that truck will be at his dealer in morning and he would have everything ready to sign Worked with Mandy in business office and she was  great also. 
5,We recently purchased a Dodge Ram 1500 truck. We got exactly what we wanted and were very happy with the price and the sales process. Will definitely do business here again!
5,The sales team was amazing at Mathews Nissan of Paris. My salesmen  Bryce made this experience easy and no  pressure to buy. All around great customer service. 
5,Texas car world is the place to go in DFW for your next car. Alex made the entire process stress free and as simple as possible. They actually hand delivered my car to my job at 11pm at night just so I would have it when I got off ! They aren’t even open that late!!!! Integrity and honesty is what they are all about . They aren’t your average car salesman these people truly care. Thank you Texas car word for getting this single mom back on the road. You guys are the best thank you for the outstanding customer service!!! 
4.1,"I just purchased my fifth car from Garland Cadillac. I have dealt with Ata Barakat since 2010. He goes the extra mile for his customer and always greets us with a welcoming smile. I highly recommend him to anyone I know who is looking for a new car.  From new car sales to customer service, service writers and body shop, the experience has always been excellent. "
4.9,"I have bought and sold a lot of cars. Browning's Reliable was by far the best car buying experience ever. Great, friendly staff, super fast and easy process, great vehicle at a great price, and easy financing. What more could you ask for. Would highly recommend, and will probably buy my next vehicle there as well!"
4.1,"Just got back my Q7 from being serviced and totally happy. My service advisor Alexa is the best there as she is very friendly, knows all about the Audi products and services. Bob Moore Audi has been servicing my Q7 for the last 3 years and never had any problems from initial call for service to the end result of a fixed Q7. Alexa kept me updated in the whole process and Bob Moore is very lucky to have a great advisor like Alexa. "
4.1,Love them Rocky was awesome and fast in helping me with my purchase i love my car and it’s affordable no hassle at all

5,"Jason & Emad are wonderful! Very helpful, professional and friendly! Haven’t had this little stress at a dealership ever before! If you’re looking, this place will be your last stop! "
5,I am so pleased w/ this car lot and the people working there!! I would like to give a big shout out to Mr.Webb!!!!!! He was AWESOME!! 
5,The best used car dealership and the salesman True was the truth. I would recommend this car dealership to any one looking to own their own vehicle.
5,Purchased a truck from them from out of state. It arrived smoothly and just as described! So thankful! Even months later when I needed some paperwork Martha and Richard went out of their way to continually help me. So thankful and appreciative!
5,Fast and easy! Steve was very professional and the process was seamless highly recommended. The dealership is very nice and people are very friendly. If you are looking for a Tesla or get lucky and find another vehicle in their inventory this is the place to go!
5,"This is my second vehicle I’ve purchased with Barrett. My first car with them was a Ford Fusion 2013. I tell you that car was very reliable. Times got rough for my family and we fell on hard times. Barrett team worked with us while we got back running. Thanks so much!!!! My second vehicle was my candy red camero. The process was short sweet and easy. They approved me fast and the service I received was amazing from this team. Thank you guys so much and keep that high energy, smiles, hospitality,accuracy, and great products with service you guys have given me since day one.

5,"I came into CarMax in Tulsa to discuss a specific car located in Texas. I was helped by Jaime Monroe and she was very knowledgeable and did not pressure me to buy anything. They are bringing the car I want to buy from Texas for FREE and based on the guarantees CarMax provides I feel so comfortable making the purchase. This is the easiest purchase of a vehicle I have ever had. Thank you Jaime, I’m very satisfied and at ease with my choice!"
5,This dealer has a great variety of inventory and has it conveniently indoors.  You can conveniently shop regardless of the weather outside.  The staff always listens and try to help the best way possible.  Highly recommended.
5,By far one of the best dealerships I've ever been to! Everyone there is awesome and they go above and beyond to help you.
5,Wow..... I love the customer service. Lori followed through with my requested. She was very professional and a woman of her words.  Rance was a true professional  and made us feel at home. He made us feel we were part of his family. I recommend this dealership to my friends and family any day and every day.  For those doubters out there.  I did my home work and got the best deal I could find in the Dallas area. Thank you Destination Motorcars 
5,I would definitely recommend this car lot to anyone in need of help.. The owner Mr. Fadi is truly a blessing  he goes above N beyond. He will work with you to his best ability. He has been my angel in my situation. I am so thankful for him.. As long as u are honest and communicate he will go above N beyond to make sure you are busy satisfied. He actually cares about u not just making a buck and that goes very far.. so again come talk to Me Fadi he will definitely make you happy also.
5,"I’m so very happy with my recent purchase. This is my second purchase from Discount Motors. Very happy with the 1st one too. Biggest difference was my sales person Frank Puente very professional, helpful and understanding. "
5,"Best car buying experience for the 2nd time!  Worked with Tyler Roman today, who went above and beyond for us.  Took <30 minutes to purchase! "
5,"Tyler was a knowledgeable professional starting the car buying process and ending the car buying process.  My husband contacted Tyler about a 2009 335I BMW that he saw on Facebook.  Tyler immediately responded back and updated my husband regarding the specifications on the car.  We then met Tyler in Plano to look at and test drive the car.  We loved the car's body and how well it had been maintained.  The engine was also very well kept..  We bought the car.  We live in Fort Worth, so Tyler delivered the car to us in Arlington so we did not have to make a long drive.  Tyler definitely knows how to treat his customers.  He called a couple of days later to make sure that my son was enjoying his new Beemer!
I look forward in doing more business with him in the future.

5,My wife and we’re looking for a used Jeep Wrangler JK with lowest miles etc. We decided to visit Perry’s Car Co because they had a good selection of Jeep Wranglers to choose from. From the first meeting with Perry we felt comfortable and confident of what he was telling us about the Jeeps. He explained features and options on each one we looked at. After discussing my trade in we agreed on a price for a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sport and purchased it that day.
5,"Though hole process was easy and selection was 
Good sales men very helpful would highly recommend the Sapulpa location stop by take a look   Great people "
5,"Ride n Drive is like a car buying home to me! Mike (and actually the whole team) has never been anything but Stellar, kind, helpful and genuine. I have bought a 2013 BMW x5 from them as well as a Fiat 500 sport, both times i was blown away by the over the top service. Mike made sure that both times the cars where in excellent condition before we where allowed to take them. I pointed out things on the test drives that i would have to have someone look at, and each time they fixed it before the delivery. Short and Sweet, right now i'm working on how to purchase my 3rd from them. I will never look anywhere else if I am shopping for a used car. So pushy sales, just honest advice. I recommend them to all my friends and family, because in the end i know they will do the right! "

5," Bought a 2000 Nissan Frontier and once got it home discovered a couple of issues not previously detected.  Brought it back on Monday morning and every issue was taken care of, at no additional cost to me, and the vehicle was reexamined with a fine tooth comb.  Thank you to Dave and the staff at Specialty Autoplex for your excellent customer service and dedication to quality vehicles."
5,This place was awesome!! I called and spoke to a young man named Cody. Told him him it was no big deal weather I bought or not but what to see what he could do. In a matter of two hours he called back with a deal I couldnt refuse. My payments for a brand new vehicle were 25 bucks more than the 7 year old car I had bought a few years ago. Needless to say I bought!!! You want a great deal and great service call Cody in Eastland. Dude is good and respectful. 
5,Ken made the whole process super easy and i got a fantastic price on my new Jeep! Would HIGHLY recommend TX Brand Auto to anyone needing to purchase a new car.
5,They are very easy to work with and unlike most dealers they put the prices of the vehicles in the windows. So no pricing games. They have great deals on their vehicles and they are nice too. Will definitely buy from here again when ready to. They also have their own service shop for you to take your car to get worked on. The guys there Chuck and Roy are very knowledgeable and don't try to up-sell you on fixing things you don't need at this time. 
5,Very friendly and helpful and has very reasonable prices. We have bad credit and they didn’t hold that against us! I have 2 small children and we weren’t there very long 
5,Went in looking for a very specific auto and left with one completely different but better!  Staff was quick and helpful. I waited less than 10 minutes for all negotiations and trade in assessment.  Staff stayed late that evening to complete the sale and trade in. 
5,"My first time to ever buy a car from a dealership and I could not have been more pleased!! These guys made it the best and easiest experience! They answered any questions I had, as well as ones I didn't even think of, about my new vehicle!! I consider myself lucky to have come across genuine people and great customer service!! They normally sale trucks but I got blessed with a car they had! Thank you so much for giving me hope in financing a car! Y'all are the best!"
4.2,"Amos is the undisputed expert and dealer in 1955-57 T-Birds. His cars are impeccable. He will ask what you want in the car, Extent of restoration, and he and his son literally know every proper nut and bolt on these special automobiles. He always has many in stock and has sold hundreds. I just emailed him yesterday needing some advice on something I wanted to add to my own 57 Bird. I did not buy it from him, as it came from an estate sale. There was nothing in it $ wise for him to share his expertise. Yet this morning he had emailed me back with specific info, potentially saving me headaches and $$. It is entertaining just to look at his website. He also has a lot of other 50s Ford expertise as well."
4.1,"Zach Sherman, is the man!! He made this whole process so easy for me. He was always reachable, and i really appreciated that. I highly recommend him!! Thanks for helping with my purchase."
4.1,After car shopping at 3 places and getting denied I came to Mr.Bills and Lucas helped me I was in and out. I told him I wanted a roomy car because of my kids always kicking the seats and he got me a roomy car! Stop wasting your time & go to Mr.Bills Lucas will make it happen even if everyone else denied you!! 
4.8,I drove all the way from Arkansas for the car I wanted.  When I arrived it was very clean and shiny.  Went for a test drive with Isaac who was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Came back and didn't haggle.  Started paperwork and was out of there in all under 2 hours.  Everyone was friendly and everything was as promised with the Yukon.  At least at this dealership I feel like they took our safety seriously.  Everyone was wearing a mask and social distanced.  Got a little tight and somewhat loose when we went for walk through and discussion on GM app and onstar.  The person doing the financing knew their stuff and was outstanding to work with.  
4.8,I had a amazing experience at this dealership. Larry Parks is awesome with great customer service skills. They stayed in contact with me throughout my whole process. They made sure I was aware of everything that was going on and overall satisfied. 
4," From our own personal experience with buying a vehicle from this dealership:
This 360 Smart Car / Kamkad (or whatever name it is at the moment), is a complete scam. Just watch the News reports. Google search 360 Smart Car investigation. Yes, it is the same dealership, no matter what they tell you. Look at the location. Same employees. They changed their name to fool people. This same company is in the news elsewhere, too.  Here is why I'm so upset and trying to let everyone know to beware. Please keep in mind, too, that this is such a dreadful company, that NO ONE has bothered to reach out to us in an attempt to make this right.
They charged us THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS for an extended warranty on a car they sold us 6 months ago (Nov 2018), and they have never paid the warranty company! So we have no warranty on our 8 year old car we bought from them because they pocketed our warranty money!  Seriously, who does that???!!! To the owner or manager: I hope you're having a good time with our $3,500 at your ""Family owned and proud"" business of yours. Are you proud of yourself for scamming money from hard-working people? I can only hope that this happens to you one day! I sound bitter don't I? Well, let someone steal $3,500 from you and then tell me you're not bitter.  We have three girls in college, we can't just walk to our backyard and get more cash off our money tree and buy another $3,500 warranty.
I just happened to call the warranty company in Feb of 2019 to ask if I would get a contract in the mail; and they told me, ""Oh, your contract has never been activated because the dealer never paid us for it.""  Whaaaaaat?? Now, no one at this ""more-names-than-Elizabeth-Taylor"" dealership will call me back or return my emails! I mean why would they call me? They're obviously too busy vacay'ing in the Grand Caymans with our stolen money.
Not to mention this: 2 to 3 WEEKS AFTER we bought the car, they called us to say they were changing the finance co. to a different finance co. because the 1st one went out of business. WEEKS LATER!  Ummmm, why did it take them so long to contact us? The paperwork was just sitting on someone's desk collecting dust for WEEKS! That's why. Oh, and I'm not done: They also tried to raise our interest rate on the new paperwork/contract. Are you kidding me?? It was only after I told them they could have the car back, and they could shove their higher interest rate up their you-know-what, did they agree to keep the rate the same. So, we had to go back to this freakin' dealership to sign all new paperwork with a new finance co. on it. Oh, and I called the original finance co. and they told me they did NOT go out of business. Hmmm. Of course, we didn't get our plates until months later and we asked them to mail the plates to us because we didn't want to go back there AGAIN. They said no, so we had drive back out there to pick them up. 
I have proof of all this, so NO ONE can say that I'm lying!!!!!!!  If these people were good or honest at all, don’t you think they would have paid our warranty by now? Do you want this to happen to you?
I’m not upset with our sales people who helped us, but rather owners and management who actually took our money and didn’t pay our warranty. 
Please understand, I am normally a very, very patient and easy-going person. But this dealership has caused soooo much heartache and frustration; and they’ve caused us many sleepless nights. They stole from us. And they don't care! Don't make the same mistake we did. DO-NOT-BUY-ANYTHING-FROM-THIS-DEALERSHIP!! If you do decide to go there anyway, please run to your doctor first and get a quick CT Scan; just to make sure you have a brain. Yes, I’m angry and I should be! Can I be any more clear? I don’t think so.  "

4.2,"Saw a Great Deal price listing on Car Guru's from this dealership for a top trim model 2015 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite. After scouring all other dealer sites and possible options it was clear that the vehicle from this dealership was priced well below market value. I called on a Sunday not knowing that the dealership was closed, but Jason answered my call and was awesome right from the start. He told me the vehicle was still available and that there was someone else scheduled to come up and see the next morning, so I made an appointment for that next afternoon. Jason kept me updated on the status of the vehicle and he let me test drive/check out the vehicle for a couple of hours. Vehicle had some cosmetic repair work which was evident but they did a good job at getting it looking in the right condition. I was extremely pleased with everything until we got inside to pay and found out that the price posted online hadn't yet added in ""Service Fees"" for performing the repairs. Van ended up costing ~$2,200 more than what was listed on Car Guru's, but the cost still ended up being about the same as what I'd seen on other sites while looking. Seemed kinda like a bait and switch tactic, but all in all I was happy with the vehicle that I received and Jason found me a great interest loan through a credit union . Was able to get 0 Down at 4.25% based on a 703.. I'd definitely recommend them again thanks to Jason. He made the whole process extremely easy and was very accommodating. Their current location is a little cramped, but they're just about to move to a new lot. Look forward to doing business with them again. Recommended."
4,Great cars and very knowledgable and friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place if youre in the market for a used vehicle. I bought a 2017 corrolla from them and im loving it
4,"I just leased a new 2019 Mazda3 from Davis-Moore, and it was hands down the easiest purchase I have ever made! My sales person was Ryan Schauf. He was friendly and responsive when I asked about the availability of the car I was looking at online, and when I came to look at it, the vehicle was clean, warmed up, and ready for a test drive. He drove first to really show off some features of the vehicle I had no idea were even there, and then he directed me on a preset route (although he was willing to let me pick some of the streets I wanted to test as well). He was extremely professional and I never once felt rushed or pushed into buying anything.

When it came time to talk price, I spoke with Ryan, but also the sales manager Chris Meek. Both of them really went above and beyond to get me a great deal! They immediately gave me an excellent price, and I appreciated that there was little need to go back and forth to get a good price. Chris was fantastic!

When I was ready to move to finance, they were busy! I had to wait a short time before going in, but their waiting area is loaded with TVs, snacks, drinks, and even classic arcade machines that were set to free play to keep me occupied! I've never seen that before! I put in some time trying to beat the high score on Donkey Kong while I waited, and that passed the time quickly. This will be very nice when I come back for service as well!

When it came time to meet with the finance manager, I worked with Dominic Feld. He was quick, efficient, and amazing to work with! Like most people, I'm usually I'm on edge when it comes to the financing side of buying, but my experience with Dom was calm and relaxed. He really made me feel at ease. Dom respectfully offered some products that he thought would compliment my new vehicle, and I made sure to take advantage of a few of them like the Wheel and Tire protection (especially with how much construction we have. I've lost too many tires to nails and screws the past few years!). But what I really liked was that he never pushed me into anything I wasn't interested in. Similar to when we discussed the price of the car, if I declined a service, there was none of the back and forth for hours like many other place I have bought before, and I was in and out of the finance office within 10 or 15 minutes. Lightning fast compared to some of my past experiences! In fact, the whole experience was quick, as from the time I arrived for a test drive to driving away with my new car, I was only there for a little over an hour and a half! It was the fastest buying experience I've ever had, and I have to say it's because of their professionalism and efficiently.

Finally, when I was finished with financing, Ryan had gotten the car cleaned up and ready for me to drive away. He had even already moved the plate from my trade in over to my new one! Before I left, he went over a few more features to make sure I knew what everything did and how to properly operate my new car, and even helped me move some of my things over from the car I traded in.

Davis-Moore Mazda, you were amazing, and really made my purchase feel special. Thank you to everyone for making my car buying experience easy, quick, and honestly enjoyable! Ryan, Chris, and Dom really went above and beyond! If anyone is looking for a new or used car from Davis-Moore, I wholeheartedly recommend working with them!"
4,Great place to buy y a car. Kristen is super great I told her what I wanted and she had it ready and waiting. I will be leasing all of my cars here. And will always request Kristen. Good job.people.
3.8,Very easy to work with.  Mike was great.  Encouraged a through test drive and mechanical checks.  Very different from the large chain dealerships I've tried to deal with.
3.9,Auto class dealer made the situation right from my earlier review.  I left a satisfied customer and Chad and team made me happy. I felt liked they cared 
3.8,"I purchased a 2019 F-150 I found off their internet add in December.  I am in CA and did the negations by phone text and email.  When I arrived to turn in my old truck and pick up the new one there was literally nothing in the file for the transaction.  I had paid for a shell and leather upgrade as the down payment so I was locked to this truck (they were never able to provide the receipts for the shell or aftermarket leather).  I was told my trade in would be upper half of their online value estimator because it has 20k miles left on extended warranty, under seat safe and air assist bags, and in excellent condition, that was 11 to 16K (estimator value) so I was told 13K up would be trade value.  On arrival they found no issues and said 11K.  I was told no problem to switch low profile tires and upgraded rims for the smaller standard rims and higher profile tires and would get a credit as the rims were  $1,200 upgrade.  No note on this in the file, I ended up with tires and rims off of a trade in with 19k miles, no credit for used tires or the value of the rims, told take it or leave it.  

I repeatedly asked for the pricing work sheet because numbers didn't work out as they described and my repeated requests were flat out refused.  All numbers were on on a blank 8x11 sheet of paper and they could not give a purchase number, tax rate or what number taxes were calculated from.  Exacerbated, I signed the paperwork and left to CA.

I made CA DMV appointment to register, the first week January and DMV had nothing from the dealer.  Dealer check and application arrive 34 days after purchase, DVM calls me to come down and because the 30 day temp registration expired the fine was just under 2K!  DMV had no way to determine purchase price to calculate taxes.  So I had to get a 30 temp registration, and finally got Home Town Motors to send the pricing sheet.  Back to DMV 3rd time, the lady laughed at the sales financing form compared to the  pricing sheet.  Another $965 to DMV that was not calculated properly and the vehicle was finally registered in early February.  I called and talked with the finance person I dealt with because he was the only one I could get to answer the phone and asked that they reimburse me for the fine I received because their paperwork was late and pay 50% of the additional fees they improperly calculated.  I was promised a manager would get back to me, nothing.

I purchased a truck from Corwin Ford in Nampa Id. the same way in 2015.  I arrived, they had all the paperwork in a folder, signed in less than 1/2 hour.  Went to CA DMV the next week everything was correct. no Problems.  

I don't think the Folks at Home Town Ford are intentionally dishonest, but rather in way over their heads, with poor or no business processes in place and internal communication is all verbal with no records.  They are not equipped, or experienced to do out of state or online sales.  They knew I was screwed because I had paid for the leather and shell as well as traveled 900 miles to pick up the new truck.  As such they did not in anyway try to reach any compromise regarding the trade in value, tires or provide detailed costs of the transaction.

Unless you can conduct ALL transactions in person, make notes and demand documentation of all the transaction details before agreeing to anything, you should pay a bit more and go somewhere else."
3.9,"Worst place ever when we purchased our car we bought protection plus plan for $1400  and GAP couple months later the car was total loss and we  did a claim they requested a cancellation of warranty and I contacted them they never responded try to contact Keith the manager and he said he doesn't handle  financials. they transfer me to Luis that told me he was going to call me back in 30 min and here I am waiting 3 months later I finally contact the protection plan company and they NEVER RECEIVED PAYMENT  for the policy so they never activated the protection plan..
Apparently CASTLE HILLS MOTORS was supposed to refund the $1400 to the lender and as of today they have not received anything .. please don't buy from this place they are going to steal your money!!"
3.9,I apologize for my delay. I wanted to update everyone. I left a review on 30 july 2019. I had a really bad deal when i bought my truck. Things weren't as promised and them refuse to finish and make it right. After leaning my review i received a phone call. The me owner was on they other end of the phone and explained that he had recently bought the dealership and wanted to see if he could try and make it right. He had his guys come and get the truck a day or so after . i don't know what's wrong with it at this point. But giant thanks to Brian for being concerned. I Will Update again when we're done with this mess
3.9,"This dealership is the worst, they tried holding back a $500 check because I gave them a bad review but then sent me the check for $500. Brad and finance crew are nothing but crooks. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. "
3.7,"Bob Stalling was great. From start to finish. We live in Houston and purchased from Dallas because we had a bad experience with Ron Carter Hyundai. We made the right decision. Absolutely no extra fees at Bob Stallings. The price I was quoted over the phone is exactly what I paid. No bogus fees.  My daughter is so happy. If you are in the market for a new vehicle I suggest everyone contact Bob Stallings. Even if you want another make and model please contact Julian Salazar at  Bob Stallings before you buy anywhere else. Trust me. He started the deal Monday morning and was driving the vehicle to Houston by 2pm. It would have been done earlier but I held it up a little.  Think about that for a minute. He was driving it to Houston.  Wow. That is customer service.  Not to mention I purchased the exact same vehicle for 2512.00 cheaper at Bob Stalling compared to Ron Carter. Wait the vehicle at Ron Carter had tinted windows and a pin strip. I guess that’s worth 2500.00 dollars at Ron Carter Hyundai. There are still great dealerships out there and I found one in Bob Stallings Hyundai.

3.7,"We recently purchased a Pre-Owned Volvo. Samuel Dixon was a key component in our purchasing experience. He is knowledgeable, service oriented and easy to work with. Thanks to Samuel and the Grubbs team for working diligently to get us the vehicle we wanted. "
3.7,We drove down from Amarillo tx to test drive a new ram truck. Ryan was extremely easy to get along with. I didn’t feel pressured into anything at all and they gave me exactly what I wanted for my trade in. I have never experienced an easier car deal in my life . I will 100% be coming back in the future for my next vehicle.
3.7,"They offer great deals online and advertise low prices. But what they dont tell you is they add a $1700 fee that is completely nonnegotiable. This fee supposedly covers their work on the car that makes it certified preowned. But this is a legal requirement to advertise the car as certified so therefore should not be a fee. They basicly lie to you about the price until you are sitting down in their office. Do not go here, and if you do go ahead and add that $1700 to every price tag. It's clear they do this so their cars come up as the best deals online, this practice is immoral and downright despicable. "
3.8,"This is low stress car buying.  Dealt with Dave DeShazo and he was of great help.  Was able to provide information and photos on the vehicle.  Since I was driving from Houston, this was of great assistance.  Would highly recommend Zigler and will be my first stop when looking for another car.

3.7,"Oh, no! After waiting three weeks for an appointment, they took my Chevy Malibu back to the service bay for a GM recall issue they came back and said it will be 1.5 hours before they can get to it and the software update takes 2 hours. So, we're supposed to wait in the COVID-city waiting room because they can't schedule properly or tell people in advance that you should be prepared to leave the car for 3 to 4 hours? No one is doing the socially distancing thing in here while Denton virus numbers are so high. NO WAY will I ever buy a car from them or use their service again. Upon asking for my car back, the service attendant just said ""Oh, OK, whatever."" Tammy was nice but totally powerless to help. The scheduling people should TELL customers about the expected wait time even when you have an appointment! What a sloppy, stupid system and poor customer service. I guess because they make no money off of a recall, you don't matter."
3.7,The service dept personnel are very professional they took my vehicle in told me what needed to be repaired.  Then made the repairs very promptly and then we were on our way. Thanks to all in the service dept & Todd.
3.7,This dealer is a FRAUD! I purchased a Wrangler from them on 6/3/20 paid wire transfer immediately. It’s 7/26/20 and I still didn’t get the car. After involving the local county sheriff I got a hold of owner Constance that promised me that she will personally take matters onto her own hands since her manager Brian and her salesman Joe kept lying to me over the last almost 2 months that they will ship the car soon. Outrageous! I found my own shipper and now they blame COVID-19 issues at the dealer. What next? ...

3,"This dealership isn't even worth the 1 star I gave them. Don't waste your money. Purchased a truck a few months ago, and already trying to get out of after having to spend $3,000 on it right off the bat. We understood it was a used card dealership, but was hoping for a truck that would at least last a couple years considering it is a 2017model. All of their trucks are worn, and covered up very well to buyers.

3.4,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIGN TO GET A CAR FROM HERE << HERE IT IS!!!>> purchasing a car is always a long process, so there you go. That is the only complaint.It took an agonizing 4 hrs, but well worth the wait. I had the pleasure of dealing with a down-to-earth gentleman out in Rowlett, TX. Rudy made us feel like family and honestly that may have been what sold me lol. My husband and I went up there expecting something great and we were super happy with receiving a great deal on something even better than I thought. All in all, its worth the wait, and worth looking into. I am super satisfied with the hospitality and not to mention the selection they had was great.i  Absolutely, 100%, recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a vehicle. Thank you Berrett Motors, it is a pleasure and shout out to Rudy and the boss man who helped us every step of the way!! "
2,"First off; No place for customers to park. Filled with cars for sale and rental cars. We parked on the street.
Second: Salesman never introduced himself or gave us a card.
Third: When we called the main number it rang about 10-12 times. They always said he is not at his desk. One time we saw he was at his desk and called just to see what the person who answered the phone would say, which was ""Not at his desk, out with a customer.""

As of December 2018, approximately 120 days later, I still do not have license plate or registration, and my last 3 emails to the owner have gone unanswered. In two days, I will be driving with expired temp tag. They also took approximately 60 days to pay off the loan on the car I traded in. This dealership is every reason why people cringe at the thought of buying a car."
1.8,"I bought a brand new MDX from Mac Churchill - the one that went bankrupt in North Fort Worth.  It had a bad transmission, which they replaced with a transmission that was so jerky you wouldn't believe how awful it was to drive.  After numerous complaints and no repair, I finally sold the car.  I took a loss of course.  Then I requested a refund on my extended warranty agreement, which they owe me.  They have not refunded it and it's been almost a year.  They have horrible service and will cheat you out of your money if they can.  I would never buy from another Mac Churchill dealership."
3.7,"Very helpful people who went above and beyond to make my experience great 
They answered all my questions and were very respectful and knowledgeable too."
1.6,"DON'T purchase a car here UNLESS it has an original factory warranty AND a clean Carfax.  The pre- purchase transaction was friendly and promising.  Post purchase was lousy.  I had a ""We owe"" ticket for a second key fob that the the previous owner (who purchased used Porsche} promised to bring in.  When she did, the owner (Sami) refused to send me the key fob because he did not want to pay the postage.  My son picked it up for me because I have stage 4 cancer and have a comprised immune system plus COVID-19 is full effect.  Three weeks after my temporary plate expired and MANY texts, the salesperson informed me that the plate had been in for 4 weeks and that Sami would not send them out.  Reason:  Unknown.  Perhaps he made a error in selling me the car at a price he re-thought was too low!  I had to enlist the help of the Plano PD to have the plates sent to me which I received the next day.  Unfortunately, the owner (Sami) let the salesman go.  Nice guy!  In closing, there might be a reason why these cars are not purchased by factory approved dealerships.  My thought is, most are auction cars with  warranties that are expired or due to expire in miles or years.  Factory dealerships don't want the deal with the issues of cars that do not meet their standards."
1.4,I went and bought a truck paid off with receipt in hand and it got repoed went through a friend that had a car from there I took over payments car was taken filed a report and Abilene used car sales repoed it so what kind of car lot is this so this is how they make there money the truck I paid off was $10000 and the car I took over payments on I was still paying on owed $5000
1.4,"AVIS is not selling the cars, its third company IFS who is dealing with the sale & rent agreement, which is not registered with the funding companies like BOA/DCU and other big brands.
Evaluation takes time and sales team didn't provide all the information for the seller companies information ( as per site- AVIS is selling ) but during financing/funding, it is found that IFS is a broker.
I would not recommend to go with AVIS Car Sales."
1.4,"I would not recommend this dealership because I bought an extended warranty from them and then cancelled it within the cancellation period. They have not refunded my purchase after over 90 days. I have called the manager, Adrian several times, and he promised to give me my money back but never did. Now we're probably going to have to go to court."
3.4,Dealership called / texted me to come in and look at truck I had seen on-line and was very interested in.  Get to dealership and the owner's son has the vehicle out joy riding and I can't look at the vehicle.  Drove over 30 mins to get there.  Completely unprofessional.

So upon delivery of car that came shipped in a enclosed trailer I noticed the car had a decent amount of rock chips and I decent size scratch on the bumper Then I put the car on my lift in the garage and noticed the tire had a busted belt in the sidewall. I emailed the dealer and they told my Goodyear should cover this. I took car to local dealer they laughed and said No Then I took it to Discount tire and they told me to call Goodyear I called them and they refused I spent 2 days trying to get this $300 plus tire replaced. So I called Crockett and he agreed to pay for it. I thought ok greatwhat a stand up dealership.... So I ordered tire from discount tire. I went to have tire install and found out the Rim was bent and couldn't be repaired... So I emailed and called Crockett and his response was he wasn't paying for $1000 Rim..

1,"Purchased a vehicle, or I should say LEMON from Sunrise Used Cars in Lindenhurst last month, and was informed by the owner Joe at Sunrise, that he sold the car for Elite Motorsports. I have had problems with this vehicle within 2 days after picking it up. I called Joe at Sunrise and requested a refund, he refused and stated he sold the car for Elite Motorsports and to take it up with them. Can you believe the audacity? I paid Sunrise Used Cars and he is passing responsibility onto Elite Motorsports and then they denied Joe's claim. I found Elite Motorsports to be dishonest when I insisted something was terribly wrong with my vehicle, they told me to bring it to their location, and was promised a full diagnostic. I requested the diagnostic report, but they refused it, I asked for their Technician notes, and while Frank, their service manager was looking for them on his computer, he conveniently tells me he accidentally deleted them. I'm told the car was brought there for the inspection, yet how does a vehicle with extremely bad brakes, and other issues pass inspection? My vehicle goes back a second time, and this time I give them a diagnostic report from Audi and Elite Motorsports stated their diagnostic was inaccurate, Audi are thieves and they do not know what they're doing. Diagnostic Reports are inaccurate? REALLY? My vehicle has now been sitting for two days because it has a bad leak. Kai from Elite Motorsports promised me he would pick up my car, but the day my car  was suppose to be picked up he calls and states, his truck is down. TRUCK IS DOWN? You fix cars, why is your truck down for two days now? Just more lies. Then he has the audacity to tell me to pay for a tow to his shop. My car vibrates terribly, car is leaking oil (I believe transmission oil) that ruined my driveway. AC doesn't work, and I could go on and on.

I arrived beforetheir posted closing time only to find out they are closed early and no one is there.  I messaged them on FB through the ad they had posted asking if they closed early for the day, when they responded I explained the situation and was told that no they didn't leave early for the day. 
I pointed out the time I messaged them and that I had been there walking around their lot for a few minutes before that message and they were clearly closed early.  This person stated he would have a talk with the store manager in the morning.  Then we moved onto the car at hand and this same person running the FB account informed me I should go to a different dealership to see if I fit in the car they have for sale......???.... What?!  I'm a tall guy and want to see if I fit in a little sports car and see the condition of the car before I buy it, but since it's in the owners garage I can't sit in the car?! How are you going to sell it if you can't see it?  I've been in sales/recruiting for the Army for a long time and I have never seen anything like this.  I was 100% ready to buy the car and already had the shipping service ready to transport the car back to MN too.  I'm not sure how easy it is to throw $90,000 sales out the window like that, but as you told me ""good luck"" with your business, treating people like this.  Luckily for me there is another one in the same color just up the road.  "
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE and again PLEASE don't ever even think about buying a car from this company. People trust if you found this car lot you can find another one. All this car wants is your money. We bought a car from them yes (the saleman...snake) was nice. We was about 1 week late on a partical payment of about $160. First we called to make payment arrangements (thats was out the question). We called everyday letting them know we was going to make the payment the following week. They repoed our car at 5pm the day before we was going to make the payment (don't I said we called them everyday to let them know when the payment was going to be made. Total to get car back was $715.22. We had to pay repo fees, the partial payment plus the full payment that just came due. All this had to be paid 5 days before Christmas. Also you have to go downtown to make the payment...in person can not do it over the phone. You then have to go to Irving to pick up your car and that can not be done but on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays between 9:30 - 12 and then 1:30 - 2. So I say please think and pray.  Spend your money with a car lot that cares about you the person not just your money. If we people would start working together we can show these companies who runs who!"
1,"Imagine my surprise when I thought I bought a 2016 POLESTAR car. I brought The car in for an oil change and to find out why the car is smoking from exhaust excessively? Well, I found our that the engine in the car DOES NOT belong to this 2016 but has been swapped with a 2012 engine, a standard engine with who knows how many miles is on it and not even a high output engine like what belongs in a Polestar! Imagine my disappointment when found out I bought A TOTAL FRAUD CAR! The opposite of what was supposed to be my dream car! BE AWARE!"
1,Went to buy a car on Thursday nights by Friday morning they were texting me and calling me that I need to bring it to the car back because of some fraudulent paperwork then they didn’t want to give me my down payment back. 
3,"This place is a joke! Do not buy from them! We got a car from them for over $18,000, we went to trade it in and they said the car is only worth $9,000 maybe. Not knowing (because they didn't pay attention) we got it from them. Saying the place we got it from ripped us off.. Then they realize we got it from them so they started ""working with us"" on the trade in value. 
They do NOT accept all credit, false advertising much!? We looked at a 2012 ford with 140,000 miles.. They wanted $20,000... You go to a legit dealership and they will charge that for a 2015 with less milage.. I've already researched this.. These people are money hungry!!! I've left reviews and comments on their facebook page but it keeps getting deleted. So buyers beware, they delete all negative reviews to make them look better."
2.7,"I have mistakenly purchased a vehicle from this place in February. I had to call for 2 weeks to get my first tag renewal and I have now been told that they are not extending the tags anymore. I will be driving illegally on June 8th and the only thing they told me was to go to the tax office. Their advice is for me to waste a day at the tax office, where they may or may not renew my tags, and then I get to pay for tags that the dealership should be handling. I still have no resolution and no one answers at the corporate number. Do not buy from this place. Terrible Customer Service!!"
3.6,I purchased a 2029 Stelvio from this second rated dealership. It has been one unanswered phone call after another. Had damaged items on my car that they were going to  order and replace. They installed used parts. Looking for my plates  2 months since I bought it and still don’t have them. Tried to call and speak to Mr Hamud and everyone at the dealership tries to cover up the problem and transfers me to wrong departments or straight to unidentiied voicemail. So maybe Mr Chris. Or Mr Joe Hamud would like to call. Jason has my number even though he doesn’t return calls or text messages very well and tells stories. Thanks Craig 
2.6,I was in the market for a Toyota. Mike saw me through every step and I was able to get exactly what I wanted! He treated me with utmost respect. Was not pushy at all (unlike with most other dealers). Just there to help guide me to a great decision! I highly recommend Ritz Auto Group and especially Mike!
2.5,"KNEW THESE FOLKS FOR A WHILE , SINCE 2012 , AND MAYBE EARLIER IN 2006 ?  SURE DO MISS AN HONEST CAR DEAL . SOMEHOW , NOW ITS ALL ABOUT THE PROFIT . THIS SURE IS NOT THE AFFORDABLE  , SIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD . ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN SPRAYED BY THE SKUNK , TAKES TIME FOR THE STINK TOO WEAR-OFF !      WISH I HAD GONE ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AND DRANK SOME COFFEE , AND LOOKED AT A LEXUS .

OH  WELL , ITS BETTER TO MOVE ON TO WHERE THE AIR IS A LITTLE FRESHER !"
2.3,"Contacted Ahmad Khatib (owner) on 4/15/20 about a truck I was very interested in. I told him I wanted the truck and I offered to put a down payment. He told me no, I don't need to worry about that, I trust you, ill hold it for you. I called back again to confirm I had a pre-purchase inspection service coming out. He wouldn't allow it to be taken to a mechanic. I once again offered to put a down payment on the truck, he again said there's no need to, he’ll hold it for me. I called back again to confirm I had the inspection scheduled for first thing in the morning 4/16/20, as soon as they opened. The inspection was completed within about an hour, and I had the results. Everything came back great. I called Amar right after to tell him again that I wanted the truck, and that I am coming out to get it. I once again offered to put a deposit on it, and even asked him what I need to do to secure the purchase. He again informed me not to worry, he will hold it for me, no need for anything. A few hours later, I was off of work and home getting everything together, when I received a call from Amar, saying his ""brother"" sold it about an hour ago. Obviously I was not too happy about this and requested he reimburse me for the inspection I had done. He agreed to repay me, and said he will send me a check. I didn't have high hopes he would. Its been almost two months and I have not received a check or heard anything back from him."

We got an amazing deal on the Highlander that met all of our requirements, and they worked to find us a great financing option.

Went there to fix my Trailblazer, which in my opinion, wouldn’t take my vehicle anywhere else to get fixed, and Brandon had the Corvette waiting for me exactly when he said. The way sales and service work together is seamless. Test drive conversation was nothing about selling a car, just regular conversation. I had a number in my head and Brandon hit it.

He was professional, courteous, and prompt. He provided me with the necessary information needed to move forward in the buying process.

4.7,"One of the best car buying experience i have ever had...not just in the sales side, finance side was just as good (couldn’t believe i got O% interest).  Used George strong for sales and it was his availability by text/email that won me over with this dealership. Also no add ons....tint is included along with the door strips....the price is the price.  Just wished the sold more than Volkswagen! Bought a VW GTI on reviews and it was accurate.  Buy from here, wont regret it."
4.8,Josiah was very knowledgeable & respectful of the way to buy my nice car. The vehicle i financed is a great for me because of the low mileage & the style also. Thank you for ur service.
4.7,"I just recently purchased a 1964.5 mustang and worked with Rocky.

The dealership itself has a wonderful facility with so many amazing classics to look at.

Rocky was an amazing sales rep. We talked over the phone before I flew down to check out the car and he was kind and transparent. Once we got to the facility he wasnt rushed nor pressing. He greeted me and my mother and let us take our time with whatever we needed and tried to answer every question to the best of his ability. Most importantly he was never pushy with the cars. He was focused on placing me (first-time classic owner) with the right car!

Would recommend anyone to go by streetside to look for a car. If you do ask for rocky!
"
4.6,Jacob was very helpful and patience with me when picking out a car. Very polite and down to earth and was ready to answer any question that I had! Thanks!

He was attentive, sincerely helpful, and made me feel no pressure.   He helped me find exactly what I wanted.   "
4.6,Danny Tanon was very helpful and knowledgeable. He asked us a lot of questions to understand what we were looking for. We love our Kia

Thank you!"
4.5,I bought a new volkswagen from them back in march and it had a few issues right of the bat (no fault of theirs). But allen samuels honestly did anything and everything to make sure we were taken care of. When we finally got everything straightened out we were very happy with every person we talked to and very happy we got a car from there. 10/10 would recommend. 
4.5,"Our salesman, Ben Song, was very considerate and thorough in helping us find the right car, negotiating a value for our trade in and coming to a final deal. The inventory is great. "

4.8,"Buy about 12 trucks a year based on need from all over the country.  Absolute best experience on a used truck I could have asked for.  I live 500 miles from this dealership, truck was as described, at a fair price, with great follow up from the sales people post sale.  A genuinely good car buying experience.  "
4.7,"I have been very pleased every time I have had my Sonata Hybrid in for service and maintenance.  They are efficient, friendly and helpful with any questions I may have."

4.8,"We had previously purchased two pre-owned Subarus from Adventure Subaru buth this was our first new vehicle. Shannon, our salesperson,  was helpful but not pushy. She was knowledgeable and patient as we stumbled our way through the process. Speaking of which, was pleasant and unrushed all the way from the test drive through to financing. Would definitely recommend Shannon at Adventure Subaru to anyone in interest in purchasing a new Subaru. "
5,Thank you Robert Szyka & Corvette World Dallas for getting me into a 2018 Corvette Z06 Carbon 65 Edition. The 1st time I walked into Corvette World I went in only to ask questions and get info. Robert stopped what he was doing answered all my questions. There was never any pressure to make purchase. It was one car enthusiast (Robert) educating a long time admirer. He was so informative and genuine that after 30 minutes we where at his desk doing paper work. His informative approach & patience made me feel like this was the right decision and the right car for my wife and I. Thank you so much Robert! I'll definitely be back.
4.9,The best after sales service..Prompt service and follow up updates as you wait. The service team very professional and courteous. I can not hesitate to recommend this dealership any time

4.8,Saw an Audi on Selective’s website for a commuter. After walking though the heavy wrought iron doors I could tell first glance I wanted to be part of the Selective group. Thanks to Darrell and all the people behind the closed doors that made my Audi look beautiful 
4.9,"After speaking with Guy via text, we decided to drive to Perry from Yukon to look at a vehicle, we were greeted with nothing but honesty, smiles and a grateful attitude from every one. Julian was terrific with the knowledge of the vehicle, it was a pleasure dealing with him on a very easy transaction. everything from beginning to sitting in the finance office with Rick was a great buying experience. We are looking at another vehicle in the future and Vance will be our first dealership to visit."
5,"This was our first dealership experience and I'm so glad we chose this dealership to do business! We had originally gone down the road to the Ford dealership but the salesman there didn't listen to our needs and price range. We politely declined and decided to see what Clint Bowyer had to offer. David came out to greet us. He was very nice and listened to us, and didn't try to push a car on us we weren't interested in. Once we found a car and sat down to discuss the details, we understood why David's nickname is ""Simple"". Everything was straight-forward and honest, and he was very happy to answer any questions we had. I would definitely recommend this dealership!"
4.7,"Easiest and quickest car buying experience we have ever had by far! I loved that our salesman Mark was the only person we dealt with through the whole process. He was kind, honest, funny and genuine. And I love my new car! "
4.7,"I’m only giving it 1 star because the only thing they did right was my oil change. I needed new tires. I went to Doenges in May of 2019. I was told multiple times by their front service cashier, Olivia, that these exact tires were covered by road hazard warranty. And she AGAIN told me this when I was getting in my car to leave with the four new tires on my car. She also told me that as long as I went to Doenges it would be covered. Fastforward to today,  March 13 of 2020. My tire is needing to be aired up twice a week. I go to Doenges after I get off work. I just wanted them to patch my tire. ONLY to find out that there are MULTIPLE small holes in it and they’re not able to patch, or fix it. They REFUSED. They gave me a price for ONE new tire instead. When I asked about my warranty they couldn’t even pull up my receipt from the sale of the tires. They only were able to look at the part with the part Humber, as I’m told by Megan and Rich. Now I’m doing to have to buy ANOTHER tire for my car when the new tires are still NEW! IM FURIOUS! But don’t take into account the fact that I was TOLD that I had the warranty before I drove off their lot. And now they’re saying that they didn’t get my tires from a Toyota supplier and only Toyota vendor supplied tires are covered . I’m outraged, beyond livid. I will NEVER go back to Doenges. You have literally lost a customer. First of all, honesty is best. And if you can’t honor what you tell customers what makes us think that you’re being honest with your work? I will not be recommending this Toyota to anyone. Also, I have family who work in multiple Toyotas. So there’s that. I will be taking my car and my business elsewhere. What. A. Disgrace. You’re establishment is the worst and I hope many people see this and help them turn away from your business. Honestly, don’t trust this Toyota. Seriously."
5,Thank you Juan and Jesus for helping me get into a new Maxima. I love my new car. I'll be sure to send you all of my friends and family.

4.5,"Worst car buying experience ever! Wish negative stars was an option!
Not surprising that every one I dealt with is not listed. Every phone call/visit was one lie after another. "
4.6,Received great service from Daisy. Would purchase again. Would recommend adopting an easier way to check out. Less paperwork and more eletronic options. Also car delivery <U+0001F609>
4.6,"I received an email from Billy Bolding of a Truecar price and agreed to pay that price.
Then Billy comes out and says ""Someone got in our system and lowered the price we can't sell it for that price"" (I have it in writing from him). Then he says he can sell it for several thousand more do I still want it??? really??? why not what you put on paper? why not the truecar price we agreed to?"
4.8,"Great customer service, they found me a car that's affordable and reliable. I also love the look of the car. Great on gas too. Great experience!"
4.5,"Found a Mercedes GL350 online at Dallas Autos Direct. Was Pre-Approved by 2 finance companies before I went to test drive.. Sam made a copy of my Drivers License and sent me and my wife on a test drive.. Fell in love with the car, was ready to buy... I took my Pre-Approved offer in and JB (Hakem) looked at my interest rate and said oh no you can do better. He picked up the phone and made 2 phone calls, then he printed out a paper and told me to go .5 miles down the road to InTouch Credit Union and see Stella she will take care of me... Long story short I was ready to pay 550.00 a month for this vehicle, after the small detour I am now paying 350.00 a month with 1/4 of the interest rate..

So I am ready to give Dallas Autos Direct a 10 Star Review, however my wife is like no, not till be get the vehicle checked out.. So yesterday I took it to Park Place Mercedes for a B1 Service and check out.. Well of course after a 650.00 oil and filter change (it is a diesel) we pick it up today.. The service adviser tells me we have a real nice GL and we have nothing to worry about driving this cross country as we had asked him about..

Dallas Autos Direct will be my first call when I am looking for my next vehicle.. "
4.5,"Great guys,  not the quickest car deal I’ve ever had but it was simplified car buying.  Will do business there again in the future "
4.6,"Superb service and communication.  I bought my car from them.  Car exceeds my expectations.  I am very happy.  Al was super helpful and friendly, answering all my questions."
5,"I'm across the country and am so glad I took the leap and bought out of state, and even more glad to have done the deal with these guys. Extremely
 trustworthy, honest, knowledgeable and all of the good things you would want from the person selling you your vehicle. I'm utterly impressed with the condition of my AMG C63 and really the entire process. No complaints.

4.6,"Second car bought from these guys! Thank you so much Andre you were funny, honest and helpful. Than you again auto liquidators!!! Would recommend to anyone! It’s why I come back!"
4.8,They where very friendly and nice fast service. Zach is very great at his job would recommend to anyone anytime. Thanks for everything. Love my car.
5,"I had put off getting another vehicle because of all the hassles I had previously experienced over the years. Gave it another shot and wow, what a difference! Nick showed me exactly what I was looking for at an affordable price with no pressure!!  I was in and out in a flash, no hours of paper work!  So courteous and professional! I will not be hesitant again as long as Nick is there! Thank you Nick! LOVE MY JEEP!!"
4.7,"Thank You Mike, you were such a great help. We are very happy with our 535i. I will recommend you to all of our family and friends."
5,"One of the easiest car buying experiences ever.  I called to inquire about a car and spoke with Phil Lyon.  We live almost six hours away from the dealership and we were able to take care of almost everything over the phone.  We had the option of having the car shipped to us, but opted to drive and pick it up.  All the paper work and my car were ready when we arrived.  Phil was able to get me a great deal for my trade in and an even better deal on the car I wanted.  I would definitely recommend this dealership and Phil for your next vehicle purchase."
4.7,We bought a 2017 A3 worked with Derek on the purchase. We are out of town so most everything was taken care of over the phone. Derek was the upmost professional and came through with everything promised. Our experience was very good and would highly recommend Audi of Wichita.
4.5,20k dollar car they wanted 7k down. 12k dollar car they wanted 6k down? You specialize in bad credit? Who can't get you approved with half the cash price of the car as a down payment. But before this I was told I could pay 4800 for the 12k dollar car as down payment? I get a cosigner? Then they said my girlfriend can't co-sign for me after they told my girlfriend to co-sign and we could see if it lowers the high down payments. Overall received the run around from bo. Not to mention had two trade ins and make currently 17.50/hr with no bills when I applied made 13.50 before promotion? Girlfriend brings in 14/hr once again no bills. Then told she got approved by herself? Ain't that why she was my cosigner? Why would I want to make a huge payment for a car 100% in my girlfriend's name? While trading in two vehicles in my name? Plus making the huge payment? Ran my credit for no reason now and I visited based off the reviews. If you want to be approved give me half the cash for the car you want and I'll call your local bank and get you approved. Time wasted and very shady experience hearing multiple different things and asking multiple times for down payment. Bo is my bad review whole dealership shouldn't be punished for one shady dealer. 
4.4,I worked with Gabby. I was one of her first clients and she worked real hard to earn my business. She had the upmost professionalism at all times. She made sure all my questions got answered and made me feel good about the car i bought. I would reccomend her and her dealership to anyone looking for a car.
5,"We had an excellent experience with BBC Motorsports.  Their representatives are extremely professional and very knowledgeable. Their no haggle pricing is significantly better than any dealer we contacted and their inventory is excellent.  In addition, they worked with us to get the car exactly how we wanted it at NO price increase.  These are real car guys who understand their customers and go the extra to make the experience completely positive and worth while.  We worked with Jason and received excellent support and guidance, as well as great work from the supporting Techs.   Their facility is unique and very professional in appearance.  In every respect BBC Motorsports is a class act with the highest integrity, that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.   
Daniel and Colette"
5,This is the third car I have purchased from this organization. Two in Houston and the newest from the Dallas location. Ed and Bob both assisted in helping me choose a car and finalizing the deal. Both were extremely helpful. I highly recommend this dealership 
4.5,"Employees are friendly and knowledgeable. I always recommend Hillsboro Ford to friends.
I dealt with Chris, Sharon, Jeff and Matt. Thank you everyone at Hillsboro Ford."
4.6,"LOVE LOVE my new car!!! Greg Jones was the best!!Went over all options, friendly, professional, I knew that I could count on him. I would highly recommend him and this dealership!"
5,"Sam was my contact at European Motors. And he took care of everything. I bought 'long distance', which I was apprehensive about, but the experience was smooth, professional, VERY helpful, low pressure, and every step was explained fully and every question answered. And the car was exactly what I expected, and delivered to my front door in perfect condition and 'detailed' inside and out. Highly Recommended."
5,"We couldn't be happier with the car we purchased from Legacy Auto!  Our salesman, Christopher Allen, catered to our every need.  Every staff member we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful.  Their car selection is reasonable, and we didn't feel pressured into something we weren't comfortable woth.  I would definitely recommend them. I absolutely love my new Maxima."
5, I really messed up my credit and have a bunch of other out of the ordinary  factors but  I was able to get approved with a 9% down payment. Drove off the lot today a very happy customer in the truck I'd been looking at . If your looking for a vehicle and an excellent service experience this place really is worth your time. They even sent an uber to get me to the lot to complete the deal. 
4.3,Do not even think about. No one will return your call about anything. I finally bailed on my new car I had bought and took a loss and went back to Sewell Infiniti. I’m trying to finish that transaction but of course nobody will return my call.
4.6,This was the best buying experience that I have had!!  I worked with Rosalie Isern and Chelsea Mackey.  They were both super friendly!  No hassles and very upfront.  Excellent customer service!  I drove 3 hours because our local Lexus dealer was horrible!  I will say it was definitely worth the 3 hour drive for the service I received!
4.2,RACHID was great!!! He listene to what we wanted and got all of our questions answered.The whole crew we worked with from the time we got there to the end was great!
4.2,Salesman allowed us to test 3 different cars and was quite courteous. Only issue was not allowing us to get a copy of the deal offered.
5,"Purchase a 2020 Subaru Crosstrek from Randall Noe Subaru.  Shannon Wagoner is the best Sales Manager I have ever worked with, she made my purchase happen after another Dealership would not.  Everyone in the dealership is friendly & helpful from the moment you open the door.  Would not hesitate to recommend Randall Noe Subaru for your car purchase, what a great team."
4.9,We needed a more reliable car for our teenage daughter. Working with Kyle at 4M was a great experience. He understood what we were looking for and what we needed. The whole process was quick and easy.  The guys at 4M are great. 
4.2,Eric Rioja is on the run from the FBI for illegal cars sales. I would say the reviews are false and the real complains have been deleted. They screwed over 100s of people sailing cars with no titles. That why they can't get the permanent plates. Please contact your local police if you know where he is...the dealership has been closed and dealers license revoked by the DMV.....
4.4,"Buyers beware...bought a $130,000 2006 Hummer H1 from them and found out that the whole ABS system was removed by the previous owner. They were going to help resolve this, but now no one will return my calls or take my calls. Now $10,000 EXTRA out of my pocket. CROOKED STEALERSHIP!!!  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!  WATCH out for BRYCE!!!  No return calls for a month."
4.4,"I would not recommend this dealer to anyone. I send in a request for quote on Saturday night via internet. Receive an email from Matthew  the salesman on Monday morning, i proceed to try and contact him all  day calling 7 times with no response.  The next morning i receive an Email from the GM Keith(check in and introducing himself) in which i responded to him and tried to call him 5 times through the day with no response. SO that is 12 times reaching out to them with no response.  I call the general line and get to talk to another salesman that than tells me the car is now sold. Tell him what has happened  and express my concern for not getting any opportunity on the vehicle. A sales manager than calls me back Derek. Very rude person and bad attitude from the start, has no customer service skills. At one point he even says i am glad i sold it to someone else.

Stay away from a bad experience  and choose a quality dealer that will respond to each customer."
5,Had been looking for truck for weeks. Went my closest dealer with the printout of the truck I wanted and where it was located. The sales manager told me if I didn't want the similar truck at his dealer he couldn't help me then he walked away. I called Elder and told salesman Oliver Beltran what wanted and here it was. Oliver called me back in a few hours and told me that truck will be at his dealer in morning and he would have everything ready to sign Worked with Mandy in business office and she was  great also. 
5,We recently purchased a Dodge Ram 1500 truck. We got exactly what we wanted and were very happy with the price and the sales process. Will definitely do business here again!
5,The sales team was amazing at Mathews Nissan of Paris. My salesmen  Bryce made this experience easy and no  pressure to buy. All around great customer service. 
5,Texas car world is the place to go in DFW for your next car. Alex made the entire process stress free and as simple as possible. They actually hand delivered my car to my job at 11pm at night just so I would have it when I got off ! They aren’t even open that late!!!! Integrity and honesty is what they are all about . They aren’t your average car salesman these people truly care. Thank you Texas car word for getting this single mom back on the road. You guys are the best thank you for the outstanding customer service!!! 
4.1,"I just purchased my fifth car from Garland Cadillac. I have dealt with Ata Barakat since 2010. He goes the extra mile for his customer and always greets us with a welcoming smile. I highly recommend him to anyone I know who is looking for a new car.  From new car sales to customer service, service writers and body shop, the experience has always been excellent. "
4.9,"I have bought and sold a lot of cars. Browning's Reliable was by far the best car buying experience ever. Great, friendly staff, super fast and easy process, great vehicle at a great price, and easy financing. What more could you ask for. Would highly recommend, and will probably buy my next vehicle there as well!"
4.1,"Just got back my Q7 from being serviced and totally happy. My service advisor Alexa is the best there as she is very friendly, knows all about the Audi products and services. Bob Moore Audi has been servicing my Q7 for the last 3 years and never had any problems from initial call for service to the end result of a fixed Q7. Alexa kept me updated in the whole process and Bob Moore is very lucky to have a great advisor like Alexa. "

5,Fast and easy! Steve was very professional and the process was seamless highly recommended. The dealership is very nice and people are very friendly. If you are looking for a Tesla or get lucky and find another vehicle in their inventory this is the place to go!
5,"This is my second vehicle I’ve purchased with Barrett. My first car with them was a Ford Fusion 2013. I tell you that car was very reliable.

They are bringing the car I want to buy from Texas for FREE and based on the guarantees CarMax provides I feel so comfortable making the purchase. This is the easiest purchase of a vehicle I have ever had. Thank you Jaime, I’m very satisfied and at ease with my choice!"

5,By far one of the best dealerships I've ever been to! Everyone there is awesome and they go above and beyond to help you.

He made us feel we were part of his family. I recommend this dealership to my friends and family any day and every day.  For those doubters out there.  I did my home work and got the best deal I could find in the Dallas area. Thank you Destination Motorcars

5,"Best car buying experience for the 2nd time!  Worked with Tyler Roman today, who went above and beyond for us.  Took <30 minutes to purchase! "
5,"Tyler was a knowledgeable professional starting the car buying process and ending the car buying process.  My husband contacted Tyler about a 2009 335I BMW that he saw on Facebook.  Tyler immediately responded back and updated my husband regarding the specifications on the car.  We then met Tyler in Plano to look at and test drive the car.  We loved the car's body and how well it had been maintained.  The engine was also very well kept..  We bought the car.  We live in Fort Worth, so Tyler delivered the car to us in Arlington so we did not have to make a long drive.  Tyler definitely knows how to treat his customers.  He called a couple of days later to make sure that my son was enjoying his new Beemer!
I look forward in doing more business with him in the future.

5,My wife and we’re looking for a used Jeep Wrangler JK with lowest miles etc. We decided to visit Perry’s Car Co because they had a good selection of Jeep Wranglers to choose from. From the first meeting with Perry we felt comfortable and confident of what he was telling us about the Jeeps. He explained features and options on each one we looked at. After discussing my trade in we agreed on a price for a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sport and purchased it that day.

5,"Ride n Drive is like a car buying home to me! Mike (and actually the whole team) has never been anything but Stellar, kind, helpful and genuine. I have bought a 2013 BMW x5 from them as well as a Fiat 500 sport, both times i was blown away by the over the top service. Mike made sure that both times the cars where in excellent condition before we where allowed to take them. I pointed out things on the test drives that i would have to have someone look at, and each time they fixed it before the delivery. Short and Sweet, right now i'm working on how to purchase my 3rd from them. I will never look anywhere else if I am shopping for a used car. So pushy sales, just honest advice. I recommend them to all my friends and family, because in the end i know they will do the right! "
5,Bought a 2008 Chrysler town and country was a great value good people to deal with very flexible will highly recommended easy terms finance available

5,This independent took initiatives rarely seen. The work was excellent. This is a big relief. I highly recommend them. George and Ray were nice to work with in addition. I am pleased to pass this endorsement on. 
5," Bought a 2000 Nissan Frontier and once got it home discovered a couple of issues not previously detected.  Brought it back on Monday morning and every issue was taken care of, at no additional cost to me, and the vehicle was reexamined with a fine tooth comb.  Thank you to Dave and the staff at Specialty Autoplex for your excellent customer service and dedication to quality vehicles."
5,This place was awesome!! I called and spoke to a young man named Cody. Told him him it was no big deal weather I bought or not but what to see what he could do. In a matter of two hours he called back with a deal I couldnt refuse. My payments for a brand new vehicle were 25 bucks more than the 7 year old car I had bought a few years ago. Needless to say I bought!!! You want a great deal and great service call Cody in Eastland. Dude is good and respectful. 
5,Ken made the whole process super easy and i got a fantastic price on my new Jeep! Would HIGHLY recommend TX Brand Auto to anyone needing to purchase a new car.
5,They are very easy to work with and unlike most dealers they put the prices of the vehicles in the windows. So no pricing games. They have great deals on their vehicles and they are nice too. Will definitely buy from here again when ready to. They also have their own service shop for you to take your car to get worked on. The guys there Chuck and Roy are very knowledgeable and don't try to up-sell you on fixing things you don't need at this time. 
5,Very friendly and helpful and has very reasonable prices. We have bad credit and they didn’t hold that against us! I have 2 small children and we weren’t there very long 
5,Went in looking for a very specific auto and left with one completely different but better!  Staff was quick and helpful. I waited less than 10 minutes for all negotiations and trade in assessment.  Staff stayed late that evening to complete the sale and trade in. 
5,"My first time to ever buy a car from a dealership and I could not have been more pleased!! These guys made it the best and easiest experience! They answered any questions I had, as well as ones I didn't even think of, about my new vehicle!! I consider myself lucky to have come across genuine people and great customer service!! They normally sale trucks but I got blessed with a car they had! Thank you so much for giving me hope in financing a car! Y'all are the best!"
4.2,"Amos is the undisputed expert and dealer in 1955-57 T-Birds. His cars are impeccable. He will ask what you want in the car, Extent of restoration, and he and his son literally know every proper nut and bolt on these special automobiles. He always has many in stock and has sold hundreds. I just emailed him yesterday needing some advice on something I wanted to add to my own 57 Bird. I did not buy it from him, as it came from an estate sale. There was nothing in it $ wise for him to share his expertise. Yet this morning he had emailed me back with specific info, potentially saving me headaches and $$. It is entertaining just to look at his website. He also has a lot of other 50s Ford expertise as well."
4.1,"Zach Sherman, is the man!! He made this whole process so easy for me. He was always reachable, and i really appreciated that. I highly recommend him!! Thanks for helping with my purchase."
4.1,After car shopping at 3 places and getting denied I came to Mr.Bills and Lucas helped me I was in and out. I told him I wanted a roomy car because of my kids always kicking the seats and he got me a roomy car! Stop wasting your time & go to Mr.Bills Lucas will make it happen even if everyone else denied you!! 
4.8,I drove all the way from Arkansas for the car I wanted.  When I arrived it was very clean and shiny.  Went for a test drive with Isaac who was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Came back and didn't haggle.  Started paperwork and was out of there in all under 2 hours.  Everyone was friendly and everything was as promised with the Yukon.  At least at this dealership I feel like they took our safety seriously.  Everyone was wearing a mask and social distanced.  Got a little tight and somewhat loose when we went for walk through and discussion on GM app and onstar.  The person doing the financing knew their stuff and was outstanding to work with.  
4.8,I had a amazing experience at this dealership. Larry Parks is awesome with great customer service skills. They stayed in contact with me throughout my whole process. They made sure I was aware of everything that was going on and overall satisfied. 
4," From our own personal experience with buying a vehicle from this dealership:
This 360 Smart Car / Kamkad (or whatever name it is at the moment), is a complete scam. Just watch the News reports. Google search 360 Smart Car investigation. Yes, it is the same dealership, no matter what they tell you. Look at the location. Same employees. They changed their name to fool people. This same company is in the news elsewhere, too.  Here is why I'm so upset and trying to let everyone know to beware. Please keep in mind, too, that this is such a dreadful company, that NO ONE has bothered to reach out to us in an attempt to make this right.
They charged us THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS for an extended warranty on a car they sold us 6 months ago (Nov 2018), and they have never paid the warranty company! So we have no warranty on our 8 year old car we bought from them because they pocketed our warranty money!  Seriously, who does that???!!! To the owner or manager: I hope you're having a good time with our $3,500 at your ""Family owned and proud"" business of yours. Are you proud of yourself for scamming money from hard-working people? I can only hope that this happens to you one day! I sound bitter don't I? Well, let someone steal $3,500 from you and then tell me you're not bitter.  We have three girls in college, we can't just walk to our backyard and get more cash off our money tree and buy another $3,500 warranty.
I just happened to call the warranty company in Feb of 2019 to ask if I would get a contract in the mail; and they told me, ""Oh, your contract has never been activated because the dealer never paid us for it.""  Whaaaaaat?? Now, no one at this ""more-names-than-Elizabeth-Taylor"" dealership will call me back or return my emails! I mean why would they call me? They're obviously too busy vacay'ing in the Grand Caymans with our stolen money.
Not to mention this: 2 to 3 WEEKS AFTER we bought the car, they called us to say they were changing the finance co. to a different finance co. because the 1st one went out of business. WEEKS LATER!  Ummmm, why did it take them so long to contact us? The paperwork was just sitting on someone's desk collecting dust for WEEKS! That's why. Oh, and I'm not done: They also tried to raise our interest rate on the new paperwork/contract. Are you kidding me?? It was only after I told them they could have the car back, and they could shove their higher interest rate up their you-know-what, did they agree to keep the rate the same. So, we had to go back to this freakin' dealership to sign all new paperwork with a new finance co. on it. Oh, and I called the original finance co. and they told me they did NOT go out of business. Hmmm. Of course, we didn't get our plates until months later and we asked them to mail the plates to us because we didn't want to go back there AGAIN. They said no, so we had drive back out there to pick them up. 
I have proof of all this, so NO ONE can say that I'm lying!!!!!!!  If these people were good or honest at all, don’t you think they would have paid our warranty by now? Do you want this to happen to you?
I’m not upset with our sales people who helped us, but rather owners and management who actually took our money and didn’t pay our warranty. 
Please understand, I am normally a very, very patient and easy-going person. But this dealership has caused soooo much heartache and frustration; and they’ve caused us many sleepless nights. They stole from us. And they don't care! Don't make the same mistake we did. DO-NOT-BUY-ANYTHING-FROM-THIS-DEALERSHIP!! If you do decide to go there anyway, please run to your doctor first and get a quick CT Scan; just to make sure you have a brain. Yes, I’m angry and I should be! Can I be any more clear? I don’t think so.  "

At an hour 50 car pulled up hour 55 they call me cost 46.71.

4,"Ask for Jesse Arredondo, best salesman by far. Went above and beyond! My daughter picked her new car up last night. Thank you Jesse and Chad!!"
4.2,"Saw a Great Deal price listing on Car Guru's from this dealership for a top trim model 2015 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite. After scouring all other dealer sites and possible options it was clear that the vehicle from this dealership was priced well below market value. I called on a Sunday not knowing that the dealership was closed, but Jason answered my call and was awesome right from the start. He told me the vehicle was still available and that there was someone else scheduled to come up and see the next morning, so I made an appointment for that next afternoon. Jason kept me updated on the status of the vehicle and he let me test drive/check out the vehicle for a couple of hours. Vehicle had some cosmetic repair work which was evident but they did a good job at getting it looking in the right condition. I was extremely pleased with everything until we got inside to pay and found out that the price posted online hadn't yet added in ""Service Fees"" for performing the repairs. Van ended up costing ~$2,200 more than what was listed on Car Guru's, but the cost still ended up being about the same as what I'd seen on other sites while looking. Seemed kinda like a bait and switch tactic, but all in all I was happy with the vehicle that I received and Jason found me a great interest loan through a credit union . Was able to get 0 Down at 4.25% based on a 703.. I'd definitely recommend them again thanks to Jason. He made the whole process extremely easy and was very accommodating. Their current location is a little cramped, but they're just about to move to a new lot. Look forward to doing business with them again. Recommended."
4,Great cars and very knowledgable and friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place if youre in the market for a used vehicle. I bought a 2017 corrolla from them and im loving it
4,"I just leased a new 2019 Mazda3 from Davis-Moore, and it was hands down the easiest purchase I have ever made! My sales person was Ryan Schauf. He was friendly and responsive when I asked about the availability of the car I was looking at online, and when I came to look at it, the vehicle was clean, warmed up, and ready for a test drive. He drove first to really show off some features of the vehicle I had no idea were even there, and then he directed me on a preset route (although he was willing to let me pick some of the streets I wanted to test as well). He was extremely professional and I never once felt rushed or pushed into buying anything.

When it came time to talk price, I spoke with Ryan, but also the sales manager Chris Meek. Both of them really went above and beyond to get me a great deal! They immediately gave me an excellent price, and I appreciated that there was little need to go back and forth to get a good price. Chris was fantastic!

When I was ready to move to finance, they were busy! I had to wait a short time before going in, but their waiting area is loaded with TVs, snacks, drinks, and even classic arcade machines that were set to free play to keep me occupied! I've never seen that before! I put in some time trying to beat the high score on Donkey Kong while I waited, and that passed the time quickly. This will be very nice when I come back for service as well!

When it came time to meet with the finance manager, I worked with Dominic Feld. He was quick, efficient, and amazing to work with! Like most people, I'm usually I'm on edge when it comes to the financing side of buying, but my experience with Dom was calm and relaxed. He really made me feel at ease. Dom respectfully offered some products that he thought would compliment my new vehicle, and I made sure to take advantage of a few of them like the Wheel and Tire protection (especially with how much construction we have. I've lost too many tires to nails and screws the past few years!). But what I really liked was that he never pushed me into anything I wasn't interested in. Similar to when we discussed the price of the car, if I declined a service, there was none of the back and forth for hours like many other place I have bought before, and I was in and out of the finance office within 10 or 15 minutes. Lightning fast compared to some of my past experiences! In fact, the whole experience was quick, as from the time I arrived for a test drive to driving away with my new car, I was only there for a little over an hour and a half! It was the fastest buying experience I've ever had, and I have to say it's because of their professionalism and efficiently.

Finally, when I was finished with financing, Ryan had gotten the car cleaned up and ready for me to drive away. He had even already moved the plate from my trade in over to my new one! Before I left, he went over a few more features to make sure I knew what everything did and how to properly operate my new car, and even helped me move some of my things over from the car I traded in.

Davis-Moore Mazda, you were amazing, and really made my purchase feel special. Thank you to everyone for making my car buying experience easy, quick, and honestly enjoyable! Ryan, Chris, and Dom really went above and beyond! If anyone is looking for a new or used car from Davis-Moore, I wholeheartedly recommend working with them!"
4,Great place to buy y a car. Kristen is super great I told her what I wanted and she had it ready and waiting. I will be leasing all of my cars here. And will always request Kristen. Good job.people.
3.8,Very easy to work with.  Mike was great.  Encouraged a through test drive and mechanical checks.  Very different from the large chain dealerships I've tried to deal with.
3.9,Auto class dealer made the situation right from my earlier review.  I left a satisfied customer and Chad and team made me happy. I felt liked they cared 
3.8,"I purchased a 2019 F-150 I found off their internet add in December.  I am in CA and did the negations by phone text and email.  When I arrived to turn in my old truck and pick up the new one there was literally nothing in the file for the transaction.  I had paid for a shell and leather upgrade as the down payment so I was locked to this truck (they were never able to provide the receipts for the shell or aftermarket leather).  I was told my trade in would be upper half of their online value estimator because it has 20k miles left on extended warranty, under seat safe and air assist bags, and in excellent condition, that was 11 to 16K (estimator value) so I was told 13K up would be trade value.  On arrival they found no issues and said 11K.  I was told no problem to switch low profile tires and upgraded rims for the smaller standard rims and higher profile tires and would get a credit as the rims were  $1,200 upgrade.  No note on this in the file, I ended up with tires and rims off of a trade in with 19k miles, no credit for used tires or the value of the rims, told take it or leave it.  

I repeatedly asked for the pricing work sheet because numbers didn't work out as they described and my repeated requests were flat out refused.  All numbers were on on a blank 8x11 sheet of paper and they could not give a purchase number, tax rate or what number taxes were calculated from.  Exacerbated, I signed the paperwork and left to CA.

I made CA DMV appointment to register, the first week January and DMV had nothing from the dealer.  Dealer check and application arrive 34 days after purchase, DVM calls me to come down and because the 30 day temp registration expired the fine was just under 2K!  DMV had no way to determine purchase price to calculate taxes.  So I had to get a 30 temp registration, and finally got Home Town Motors to send the pricing sheet.  Back to DMV 3rd time, the lady laughed at the sales financing form compared to the  pricing sheet.  Another $965 to DMV that was not calculated properly and the vehicle was finally registered in early February.  I called and talked with the finance person I dealt with because he was the only one I could get to answer the phone and asked that they reimburse me for the fine I received because their paperwork was late and pay 50% of the additional fees they improperly calculated.  I was promised a manager would get back to me, nothing.

I purchased a truck from Corwin Ford in Nampa Id. the same way in 2015.  I arrived, they had all the paperwork in a folder, signed in less than 1/2 hour.  Went to CA DMV the next week everything was correct. no Problems.  

I don't think the Folks at Home Town Ford are intentionally dishonest, but rather in way over their heads, with poor or no business processes in place and internal communication is all verbal with no records.  They are not equipped, or experienced to do out of state or online sales.  They knew I was screwed because I had paid for the leather and shell as well as traveled 900 miles to pick up the new truck.  As such they did not in anyway try to reach any compromise regarding the trade in value, tires or provide detailed costs of the transaction.

Unless you can conduct ALL transactions in person, make notes and demand documentation of all the transaction details before agreeing to anything, you should pay a bit more and go somewhere else."
3.9,"Worst place ever when we purchased our car we bought protection plus plan for $1400  and GAP couple months later the car was total loss and we  did a claim they requested a cancellation of warranty and I contacted them they never responded try to contact Keith the manager and he said he doesn't handle  financials. they transfer me to Luis that told me he was going to call me back in 30 min and here I am waiting 3 months later I finally contact the protection plan company and they NEVER RECEIVED PAYMENT  for the policy so they never activated the protection plan..
Apparently CASTLE HILLS MOTORS was supposed to refund the $1400 to the lender and as of today they have not received anything .. please don't buy from this place they are going to steal your money!!"
3.9,I apologize for my delay. I wanted to update everyone. I left a review on 30 july 2019. I had a really bad deal when i bought my truck. Things weren't as promised and them refuse to finish and make it right. After leaning my review i received a phone call. The me owner was on they other end of the phone and explained that he had recently bought the dealership and wanted to see if he could try and make it right. He had his guys come and get the truck a day or so after . i don't know what's wrong with it at this point. But giant thanks to Brian for being concerned. I Will Update again when we're done with this mess
3.9,"This dealership is the worst, they tried holding back a $500 check because I gave them a bad review but then sent me the check for $500. Brad and finance crew are nothing but crooks. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. "
3.7,"Bob Stalling was great. From start to finish. We live in Houston and purchased from Dallas because we had a bad experience with Ron Carter Hyundai. We made the right decision. Absolutely no extra fees at Bob Stallings. The price I was quoted over the phone is exactly what I paid. No bogus fees.  My daughter is so happy. If you are in the market for a new vehicle I suggest everyone contact Bob Stallings. Even if you want another make and model please contact Julian Salazar at  Bob Stallings before you buy anywhere else. Trust me. He started the deal Monday morning and was driving the vehicle to Houston by 2pm. It would have been done earlier but I held it up a little.  Think about that for a minute. He was driving it to Houston.  Wow. That is customer service.  Not to mention I purchased the exact same vehicle for 2512.00 cheaper at Bob Stalling compared to Ron Carter. Wait the vehicle at Ron Carter had tinted windows and a pin strip. I guess that’s worth 2500.00 dollars at Ron Carter Hyundai. There are still great dealerships out there and I found one in Bob Stallings Hyundai.

3.7,"We recently purchased a Pre-Owned Volvo. Samuel Dixon was a key component in our purchasing experience. He is knowledgeable, service oriented and easy to work with. Thanks to Samuel and the Grubbs team for working diligently to get us the vehicle we wanted. "
3.7,We drove down from Amarillo tx to test drive a new ram truck. Ryan was extremely easy to get along with. I didn’t feel pressured into anything at all and they gave me exactly what I wanted for my trade in. I have never experienced an easier car deal in my life . I will 100% be coming back in the future for my next vehicle.
3.7,"They offer great deals online and advertise low prices. But what they dont tell you is they add a $1700 fee that is completely nonnegotiable. This fee supposedly covers their work on the car that makes it certified preowned. But this is a legal requirement to advertise the car as certified so therefore should not be a fee. They basicly lie to you about the price until you are sitting down in their office. Do not go here, and if you do go ahead and add that $1700 to every price tag. It's clear they do this so their cars come up as the best deals online, this practice is immoral and downright despicable. "
3.8,"This is low stress car buying.  Dealt with Dave DeShazo and he was of great help.  Was able to provide information and photos on the vehicle.  Since I was driving from Houston, this was of great assistance.  Would highly recommend Zigler and will be my first stop when looking for another car.

3.7,"Oh, no! After waiting three weeks for an appointment, they took my Chevy Malibu back to the service bay for a GM recall issue they came back and said it will be 1.5 hours before they can get to it and the software update takes 2 hours. So, we're supposed to wait in the COVID-city waiting room because they can't schedule properly or tell people in advance that you should be prepared to leave the car for 3 to 4 hours? No one is doing the socially distancing thing in here while Denton virus numbers are so high. NO WAY will I ever buy a car from them or use their service again. Upon asking for my car back, the service attendant just said ""Oh, OK, whatever."" Tammy was nice but totally powerless to help. The scheduling people should TELL customers about the expected wait time even when you have an appointment! What a sloppy, stupid system and poor customer service. I guess because they make no money off of a recall, you don't matter."
3.7,The service dept personnel are very professional they took my vehicle in told me what needed to be repaired.  Then made the repairs very promptly and then we were on our way. Thanks to all in the service dept & Todd.
3.7,This dealer is a FRAUD! I purchased a Wrangler from them on 6/3/20 paid wire transfer immediately. It’s 7/26/20 and I still didn’t get the car. After involving the local county sheriff I got a hold of owner Constance that promised me that she will personally take matters onto her own hands since her manager Brian and her salesman Joe kept lying to me over the last almost 2 months that they will ship the car soon. Outrageous! I found my own shipper and now they blame COVID-19 issues at the dealer. What next? ...

3,"This dealership isn't even worth the 1 star I gave them. Don't waste your money. Purchased a truck a few months ago, and already trying to get out of after having to spend $3,000 on it right off the bat. We understood it was a used card dealership, but was hoping for a truck that would at least last a couple years considering it is a 2017model. All of their trucks are worn, and covered up very well to buyers.

3.4,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIGN TO GET A CAR FROM HERE << HERE IT IS!!!>> purchasing a car is always a long process, so there you go. That is the only complaint.It took an agonizing 4 hrs, but well worth the wait. I had the pleasure of dealing with a down-to-earth gentleman out in Rowlett, TX. Rudy made us feel like family and honestly that may have been what sold me lol. My husband and I went up there expecting something great and we were super happy with receiving a great deal on something even better than I thought. All in all, its worth the wait, and worth looking into. I am super satisfied with the hospitality and not to mention the selection they had was great.i  Absolutely, 100%, recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a vehicle. Thank you Berrett Motors, it is a pleasure and shout out to Rudy and the boss man who helped us every step of the way!! "
2,"First off; No place for customers to park. Filled with cars for sale and rental cars. We parked on the street.
Second: Salesman never introduced himself or gave us a card.
Third: When we called the main number it rang about 10-12 times. They always said he is not at his desk. One time we saw he was at his desk and called just to see what the person who answered the phone would say, which was ""Not at his desk, out with a customer.""

As of December 2018, approximately 120 days later, I still do not have license plate or registration, and my last 3 emails to the owner have gone unanswered. In two days, I will be driving with expired temp tag. They also took approximately 60 days to pay off the loan on the car I traded in. This dealership is every reason why people cringe at the thought of buying a car."
1.8,"I bought a brand new MDX from Mac Churchill - the one that went bankrupt in North Fort Worth.  It had a bad transmission, which they replaced with a transmission that was so jerky you wouldn't believe how awful it was to drive.  After numerous complaints and no repair, I finally sold the car.  I took a loss of course.  Then I requested a refund on my extended warranty agreement, which they owe me.  They have not refunded it and it's been almost a year.  They have horrible service and will cheat you out of your money if they can.  I would never buy from another Mac Churchill dealership."
3.7,"Very helpful people who went above and beyond to make my experience great 
They answered all my questions and were very respectful and knowledgeable too."
1.6,"DON'T purchase a car here UNLESS it has an original factory warranty AND a clean Carfax.  The pre- purchase transaction was friendly and promising.  Post purchase was lousy.  I had a ""We owe"" ticket for a second key fob that the the previous owner (who purchased used Porsche} promised to bring in.  When she did, the owner (Sami) refused to send me the key fob because he did not want to pay the postage.  My son picked it up for me because I have stage 4 cancer and have a comprised immune system plus COVID-19 is full effect.  Three weeks after my temporary plate expired and MANY texts, the salesperson informed me that the plate had been in for 4 weeks and that Sami would not send them out.  Reason:  Unknown.  Perhaps he made a error in selling me the car at a price he re-thought was too low!  I had to enlist the help of the Plano PD to have the plates sent to me which I received the next day.  Unfortunately, the owner (Sami) let the salesman go.  Nice guy!  In closing, there might be a reason why these cars are not purchased by factory approved dealerships.  My thought is, most are auction cars with  warranties that are expired or due to expire in miles or years.  Factory dealerships don't want the deal with the issues of cars that do not meet their standards."
1.4,I went and bought a truck paid off with receipt in hand and it got repoed went through a friend that had a car from there I took over payments car was taken filed a report and Abilene used car sales repoed it so what kind of car lot is this so this is how they make there money the truck I paid off was $10000 and the car I took over payments on I was still paying on owed $5000
1.4,"AVIS is not selling the cars, its third company IFS who is dealing with the sale & rent agreement, which is not registered with the funding companies like BOA/DCU and other big brands.
Evaluation takes time and sales team didn't provide all the information for the seller companies information ( as per site- AVIS is selling ) but during financing/funding, it is found that IFS is a broker.
I would not recommend to go with AVIS Car Sales."
1.4,"I would not recommend this dealership because I bought an extended warranty from them and then cancelled it within the cancellation period. They have not refunded my purchase after over 90 days. I have called the manager, Adrian several times, and he promised to give me my money back but never did. Now we're probably going to have to go to court."
3.4,Dealership called / texted me to come in and look at truck I had seen on-line and was very interested in.  Get to dealership and the owner's son has the vehicle out joy riding and I can't look at the vehicle.  Drove over 30 mins to get there.  Completely unprofessional.  Would not trust these guys at all.  These are the folks that give USED CAR SALESMAN their bad reputation.  Third rate organization.

1,My experience with this company was horrible unprofessional rude and disrespectful personally they were playing too many games for me that we were fully aware that I was from another state reckless that’s all I Gotta say about this place recklessI would never recommend this place to anyone at all
1,"I bought a 2019 Camaro ZL1 Convertible that had 2100 miles from Dallad Auto Exchange They had it listed on Ebay . I called and spoke with Crockett and he assured me car was mint no scratches dents or dings.... So upon delivery of car that came shipped in a enclosed trailer I noticed the car had a decent amount of rock chips and I decent size scratch on the bumper Then I put the car on my lift in the garage and noticed the tire had a busted belt in the sidewall. I emailed the dealer and they told my Goodyear should cover this. I took car to local dealer they laughed and said No Then I took it to Discount tire and they told me to call Goodyear I called them and they refused I spent 2 days trying to get this $300 plus tire replaced. So I called Crockett and he agreed to pay for it. I thought ok greatwhat a stand up dealership.... So I ordered tire from discount tire. I went to have tire install and found out the Rim was bent and couldn't be repaired... So I emailed and called Crockett and his response was he wasn't paying for $1000 Rim.. So after paying $59,500 for what was supposed to be a mint cost me an additional $1500 to have a new rim and rock chips fixed Out of State buyers BEWARE and send someone locally to inspect

1,"Destroyed new part during alignment, refused to admit fault. Had to buy a new part myself to get things fixed after much arguing. Will never come back here."
1,"Bought a Jeep from this place. Celled them after two or three days because it was making a noise. They did not call me back. Called them two more times afterwards, no return calls. The Jeep needed a new engine. This dealership showed us a false Carfax report.  We had to sell the Jeep for much less than we paid for it,  This place will not talk to us or respond to us at all.  They knew they sold us a Jeep that was in need of an engine.  SCAMMERS.  WARNING. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE."
1,"Purchased a vehicle, or I should say LEMON from Sunrise Used Cars in Lindenhurst last month, and was informed by the owner Joe at Sunrise, that he sold the car for Elite Motorsports. I have had problems with this vehicle within 2 days after picking it up. I called Joe at Sunrise and requested a refund, he refused and stated he sold the car for Elite Motorsports and to take it up with them. Can you believe the audacity? I paid Sunrise Used Cars and he is passing responsibility onto Elite Motorsports and then they denied Joe's claim. I found Elite Motorsports to be dishonest when I insisted something was terribly wrong with my vehicle, they told me to bring it to their location, and was promised a full diagnostic. I requested the diagnostic report, but they refused it, I asked for their Technician notes, and while Frank, their service manager was looking for them on his computer, he conveniently tells me he accidentally deleted them. I'm told the car was brought there for the inspection, yet how does a vehicle with extremely bad brakes, and other issues pass inspection? My vehicle goes back a second time, and this time I give them a diagnostic report from Audi and Elite Motorsports stated their diagnostic was inaccurate, Audi are thieves and they do not know what they're doing. Diagnostic Reports are inaccurate? REALLY? My vehicle has now been sitting for two days because it has a bad leak. Kai from Elite Motorsports promised me he would pick up my car, but the day my car  was suppose to be picked up he calls and states, his truck is down. TRUCK IS DOWN? You fix cars, why is your truck down for two days now? Just more lies. Then he has the audacity to tell me to pay for a tow to his shop. My car vibrates terribly, car is leaking oil (I believe transmission oil) that ruined my driveway. AC doesn't work, and I could go on and on. 
PLEASE HEED MY WARNING AND STAY FAR AWAY FROM SUNRISE USED CARS AND ELITE MOTORSPORTS. They are dishonest, and they are liars! 
The ONLY thing that brings me comfort is... G*d above sees everything, and people like this will eventually get what is coming to them. 
YOU SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!"
1,"Flew in from Minneapolis a day before I needed to be here, just to see a particular car they have for sale.  I arrived beforetheir posted closing time only to find out they are closed early and no one is there.  I messaged them on FB through the ad they had posted asking if they closed early for the day, when they responded I explained the situation and was told that no they didn't leave early for the day. 
I pointed out the time I messaged them and that I had been there walking around their lot for a few minutes before that message and they were clearly closed early.  This person stated he would have a talk with the store manager in the morning.  Then we moved onto the car at hand and this same person running the FB account informed me I should go to a different dealership to see if I fit in the car they have for sale......???.... What?!  I'm a tall guy and want to see if I fit in a little sports car and see the condition of the car before I buy it, but since it's in the owners garage I can't sit in the car?! How are you going to sell it if you can't see it?  I've been in sales/recruiting for the Army for a long time and I have never seen anything like this.  I was 100% ready to buy the car and already had the shipping service ready to transport the car back to MN too.  I'm not sure how easy it is to throw $90,000 sales out the window like that, but as you told me ""good luck"" with your business, treating people like this.  Luckily for me there is another one in the same color just up the road.  "
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE and again PLEASE don't ever even think about buying a car from this company. People trust if you found this car lot you can find another one. All this car wants is your money. We bought a car from them yes (the saleman...snake) was nice. We was about 1 week late on a partical payment of about $160. First we called to make payment arrangements (thats was out the question). We called everyday letting them know we was going to make the payment the following week. They repoed our car at 5pm the day before we was going to make the payment (don't I said we called them everyday to let them know when the payment was going to be made. Total to get car back was $715.22. We had to pay repo fees, the partial payment plus the full payment that just came due. All this had to be paid 5 days before Christmas. Also you have to go downtown to make the payment...in person can not do it over the phone. You then have to go to Irving to pick up your car and that can not be done but on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays between 9:30 - 12 and then 1:30 - 2. So I say please think and pray.  Spend your money with a car lot that cares about you the person not just your money. If we people would start working together we can show these companies who runs who!"
1,"Imagine my surprise when I thought I bought a 2016 POLESTAR car. I brought The car in for an oil change and to find out why the car is smoking from exhaust excessively? Well, I found our that the engine in the car DOES NOT belong to this 2016 but has been swapped with a 2012 engine, a standard engine with who knows how many miles is on it and not even a high output engine like what belongs in a Polestar! Imagine my disappointment when found out I bought A TOTAL FRAUD CAR! The opposite of what was supposed to be my dream car! BE AWARE!"
1,Went to buy a car on Thursday nights by Friday morning they were texting me and calling me that I need to bring it to the car back because of some fraudulent paperwork then they didn’t want to give me my down payment back. 
3,"This place is a joke! Do not buy from them! We got a car from them for over $18,000, we went to trade it in and they said the car is only worth $9,000 maybe. Not knowing (because they didn't pay attention) we got it from them. Saying the place we got it from ripped us off.. Then they realize we got it from them so they started ""working with us"" on the trade in value. 
They do NOT accept all credit, false advertising much!? We looked at a 2012 ford with 140,000 miles.. They wanted $20,000... You go to a legit dealership and they will charge that for a 2015 with less milage.. I've already researched this.. These people are money hungry!!! I've left reviews and comments on their facebook page but it keeps getting deleted. So buyers beware, they delete all negative reviews to make them look better."
2.7,"I have mistakenly purchased a vehicle from this place in February. I had to call for 2 weeks to get my first tag renewal and I have now been told that they are not extending the tags anymore. I will be driving illegally on June 8th and the only thing they told me was to go to the tax office. Their advice is for me to waste a day at the tax office, where they may or may not renew my tags, and then I get to pay for tags that the dealership should be handling. I still have no resolution and no one answers at the corporate number. Do not buy from this place. Terrible Customer Service!!"
3.6,I purchased a 2029 Stelvio from this second rated dealership. It has been one unanswered phone call after another. Had damaged items on my car that they were going to  order and replace. They installed used parts. Looking for my plates  2 months since I bought it and still don’t have them. Tried to call and speak to Mr Hamud and everyone at the dealership tries to cover up the problem and transfers me to wrong departments or straight to unidentiied voicemail. So maybe Mr Chris. Or Mr Joe Hamud would like to call. Jason has my number even though he doesn’t return calls or text messages very well and tells stories. Thanks Craig 
2.6,I was in the market for a Toyota. Mike saw me through every step and I was able to get exactly what I wanted! He treated me with utmost respect. Was not pushy at all (unlike with most other dealers). Just there to help guide me to a great decision! I highly recommend Ritz Auto Group and especially Mike!
2.5,"KNEW THESE FOLKS FOR A WHILE , SINCE 2012 , AND MAYBE EARLIER IN 2006 ?  SURE DO MISS AN HONEST CAR DEAL . SOMEHOW , NOW ITS ALL ABOUT THE PROFIT . THIS SURE IS NOT THE AFFORDABLE  , SIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD . ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN SPRAYED BY THE SKUNK , TAKES TIME FOR THE STINK TOO WEAR-OFF !      WISH I HAD GONE ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AND DRANK SOME COFFEE , AND LOOKED AT A LEXUS . TOOK SOME ISSUES TO A MANAGER , ABOUT A CAR PROBLEM ; AND BASICALLY WAS CALLED A LIAR , BECAUSE THAT PERSON DID NOT SHARE THE CONVERSATION , WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER . OH  WELL , ITS BETTER TO MOVE ON TO WHERE THE AIR IS A LITTLE FRESHER !"
2.3,"Contacted Ahmad Khatib (owner) on 4/15/20 about a truck I was very interested in. I told him I wanted the truck and I offered to put a down payment. He told me no, I don't need to worry about that, I trust you, ill hold it for you. I called back again to confirm I had a pre-purchase inspection service coming out. He wouldn't allow it to be taken to a mechanic. I once again offered to put a down payment on the truck, he again said there's no need to, he’ll hold it for me. I called back again to confirm I had the inspection scheduled for first thing in the morning 4/16/20, as soon as they opened. The inspection was completed within about an hour, and I had the results. Everything came back great. I called Amar right after to tell him again that I wanted the truck, and that I am coming out to get it. I once again offered to put a deposit on it, and even asked him what I need to do to secure the purchase. He again informed me not to worry, he will hold it for me, no need for anything. A few hours later, I was off of work and home getting everything together, when I received a call from Amar, saying his ""brother"" sold it about an hour ago. Obviously I was not too happy about this and requested he reimburse me for the inspection I had done. He agreed to repay me, and said he will send me a check. I didn't have high hopes he would. Its been almost two months and I have not received a check or heard anything back from him."
